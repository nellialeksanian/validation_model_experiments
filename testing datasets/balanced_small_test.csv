0,117,"Katarina General Guide by Persion Katarina, the Sinister Blade. Katarina is an AP Carry who outstands in teamfights. Katarina can clear out minion waves on a short time period. Katarina is a strong and versatile ganker who can easily get to her target and get away from her target.
Although you can easily jump into teamfights and get loads of kills, Katarina isn't a tank. She can't 1v5 the whole enemy team on a normal score. Katarina can only be very effective when she gets kills early game. Katarina is a melee champ, which makes it a bit harder for her to get easy minion kills early game.
This is my first guide I've ever made.
Pros / Cons
Pros:
+ Fast minion wave clearer
+ Very strong late game
+ No mana
+ Great teamfighter
+ Highly rewarding
Cons:
- Needs kills to be effective
- Isn't a tank, can't jump in 1v5 like she's Malphite
- Melee mage
- Gets focused a lot
Runes
In my opinion, pretty standard AP Carry runes. The AP gives some nice damage, while Magic Resist helps you in mid almost always to survive easily and the Magic Penetration makes sure people who build Magic Resist won't take too much less damage from you.
Masteries
Pretty standard AP Carry masteries.
Ability Power, Cooldown Reduction and Magic Penetration in Offense.
Health Regen, Health and Magic Resist in Defense.
Nothing in Utility, since Katarina doesn't need this tree. She doesn't have any mana and isn't a support either.
Items
Probably everyone thought at the beginning of this build while they were looking at the items: Where is the Hextech Revolver?
Well, Katarina doesn't need it. In my opinion, the Deathfire Grasp is a lot better early game on Katarina. She will deal tons of damage when you are doing Death Lotus and you use your active on Deathfire Grasp.
Other items are pretty obvious in my opinion. The Abyssical Scepter and the Zhonya's Hourglass make it easier for you to survive teamfights, since you get focused a lot as Katarina. The Liandry's Torment is great for the end game, since you will deal too much damage for the enemy team to even react to it, and best of all, when you get a kill or assist, you can just Shunpo to the next target and so on!
I don't start with Doran's Ring, because Katarina can get some crazy damage on her early game. This is why she needs to have Health Pots in the beginning.
Skill Sequence
Q: Bouncing Blades
W: Sinister Steel
E: Shunpo
R: Death Lotus
R > Q > W > E
To jump into fights: Q -> E -> W -> R
And then continue this order the whole game.
Farming
Try to get Creep Score by doing this order:
Q -> W
If you really want to farm a little bit more without auto-attacking, use Shunpo, but be sure you won't be ganked or you'll probably be dead.
Tips
You should get some wards in your inventory to:
- Put in your lane to Shunpo away from possible ganks
- Get over obstacles by putting the ward over the wall and Shunpo towards it
Get your teammates to be near to you over a wall when you are running away, since you could just Shunpo over the wall to get away from fights, and maybe bait some people to flash as well and melt their face down.

An Experiential Introduction
The Introductory Soul Joy experience is a natural immersion into realizing the fun in human ability
Delve into a weekend of wonder. Remember again parts of yourself forgotten and reinvigorate what you know with an immersion into the joy of the soul
Our experience offers a rich and abundant look at the individual characteristics of joy and relates them to the natural qualities of our breath with an innovative way to realize energy and emotion that is unique to current understanding and misunderstandings about this vital capacity of our human condition. We can learn to appreciate the often misinterpreted elements of both joy and emotion.
This course is designed to invite an infusion of laughter with an educated reference to its greater natural abilities and the insightfully creative genius of play to incorporate our comprehension of joy and emotion. Our Breath's ability is heightened with activity and evidence for more productive and healthy oxygenation of the body and the brain.
This will be a joyous wake-up call of what you are capable of with educational information to consider and the application of it in exercise and activity to create evidence for the evolving change that takes place in the body, the duality of our mind's processing and the filtering effect that emerges into our soul. It is rich and full and only the beginning. With heavy duty concepts to consider, this weekend of wonder turns into a weekend of wow by the simple engagement of active participation throughout. Expertly led by a Leadership Director, Coach and Laughter Training Facilitator with a creative streak for play, you will evolve and come to design your own new definitions by the course completion and engage in the depth of what could be called only the joy of the soul.

Joy has been defined by leading experts with opposing views and confusion about happiness. Emotion is assigned with a predominance for negative traits. Laughter and play have often been trivialized as being unrealistic for a busy word and breath isn't typically appreciated until we struggle for it.
Understanding that energy is matter and change is constant and something we move all the time has emerged from the ""Woo-Woo"" category to begin to be appreciated for something different.
As the status quo of current consensus for a busy, overstressed world begins to emerge and look for something better, this weekend offers a new lens of appreciation to educate, apply. and realize the natural quality of what can fill the song of your soul. Let this weekend offer you an uplifting and pleasant realization of your abilities.

9,470,"“THREE BALD EAGLES ON A NEST”
I’ve been watching these three since they hatched and it was from a friend that I found out about them—for these eagles are on UStream in Decorah, Iowa and it’s online. The web cam was put there by Bob Anderson for his job is observing bald eagles; he not only observes but operates the web cam at times and records data. This is his project and he graciously let us in to watch.
Imagine watching them closely as they are 80 feet up in the air on their nest: It’s an experience that over 100 million have witnessed. These three “juvies” have the best parents ever: They are diligent, caring and would give their lives for their babies if they had to. On chat, I have learned just about every term that applies to bald eagles from “mantling” to a “nicitating” eye lid.
No doubt some people don’t watch this and they have missed the experience of a lifetime for it is as like watching young babies with their parents: There is the desire on the babies’ part to be snuggled, fed and cared for. Week by week they have become observant of their surroundings and are curious. And week by week, you can see the change in their faces—for they are on the nest with no where to go and they are becoming more curious every day. Their wings have grown from almost nothing to a wing span of five feet. They flap their wings, hop and sleep a lot. Sleep comes after they have been fed fish or some animals by their parents and this produces a “food coma.”
First mom and dad fed each eaglet by mouth with tiny pieces of fish; this went on for weeks and weeks. At this point, dad drops off a fish and there is a scramble among the three to retrieve and eat the fish. And usually one gets it and eats it whole! Meanwhile, the other two look up in desperation for dad to drop off more fish and he always does. If one “juvie” doesn’t get any fish, dad makes sure to feed it himself, sometimes taking bites for himself.
During all kinds of weather from snow at the beginning of their birth to pouring rain this past week, mom and dad have protected these three. Usually it’s mom who stays with them during inclement weather and prior, she had stretched out her wings for coverage. But now the juvies are too big to fit underneath mom and so one or two will stick its head underneath her feathers. First of the week, it was pouring the rain and there stood mom getting drenched [but her feathers are waterproof as are all full grown bald eagles as well as the juvies now] but determined to keep her babies safe.
The juvies are hopping high and exercising their huge wings at this point—sometimes hitting another one in the face while doing so. The nest is over six feet wide and it’s getting crowded now and more so when mom and dad join them. Rest assured that the nest is strong as it weighs about one thousand pounds and is 80 feet up in a cottonwood tree! And day and night, mom and dad are always close by in another tree: They do not leave these babies alone. But they are letting them sleep alone more now so that they will become independent—for that is how nature is.
As a watcher [along with millions] it is so hilarious to see a juvie see itself in the metal casing of the web cam! One will stare and stare and you can come to believe that it is staring at you: The camera is that close. And what faces they have—so inquisitive and so cute.
By the fourth of July or maybe sooner, they will start to fledge and that means flying. But first they will do branching which means that they will jump from branch to branch first before they get their wings ready for a real flight. And no, they will not resemble their parents for they won’t get their white heads, yellow beaks or yellow eyes till they are four or five years old.
For the millions of us watching this unbelievable experience, it is a once in a lifetime chance to witness the birth and growth of these three bald eagles as well as their caring and beautiful parents.
Rob McIntyre, the president of Raptor Resoure Project, passed away while attempting to help a neighbor in Minnesota after the horrible tornado. He suffered a fatal heart attack. And his passing created a huge void with those he was associated with in the project. Didn’t know him but had seen his photos and information on the Raptor Resource Project home page online and he had spent his life working with bald eagles.
Rest assured that when these three juvie bald eagles take off, Rob’s spirit will be flying with them in the form of an eagle: How could it not?
I’d like to thank everyone including RRP and UStream for providing this unique experience for letting us all be right there in the nest—even if we are looking at it on a computer monitor. I’ve learned so much, witnessed so much and laughed when chatters write a post till I think that I am definitely an “eagleholic:” No, I don’t think it. I know I am one. Kudos to the moderators who selfishly are giving their time to keep order and civility on the live chat: You guys rock. And kudos to Bob Anderson who has panned the camera so much so that we can get views that are breathtaking.
If you’re out and about, don’t look down. Look up! You may just catch the site of a bald eagle soaring above you and you will be witnessing a miracle in feathers. This raptor is the top of the food chain with only man being its enemy—they are nationally protected by law. And well they should be. And also well that they are our national symbol—freedom, strength and majesty is what America stands for and so does the bald eagle.

I was so distracted once at a church service (away from here), from an overwhelming amount of noise from the audience, that I had a hard time concentrating on the lesson. I tried focusing my attention on the speaker, but the person behind me and a few others across the isle were extremely loud—for what seemed to be every 30 seconds. The problem? You may think I am referring to rowdy kids or fussy children, with parents who would not take them out, but in fact I am referring to adults. The noise was coming from grown people during an adult Bible class! They had coughing attacks that made it difficult for them to sit quietly.
What did I do as a member of the audience? Instead of giving them the “evil eye” or condemning them, I extended patience to them with the hope they would quiet down in a little bit. And, after a few minutes, their coughing subsided. I may have missed a few comments the speaker was making, until the coughing stopped, but I eventually picked up on the lesson and was able to benefit from the study.
I recently learned of a church of Christ that does not permit small children in the auditorium during worship services. If the children want to accompany their parents to services, they must go to a daycare within the building during worship. While this might sound like a great solution to the “fuss” caused by small children, it reeks of foulness and self-centeredness to me. How can parents rear their children in the “training and admonition of the Lord” while leaving out one of the most essential aspects to godly living: worship? What kind of message does this send to the children regarding church services? To any honest observer it says, “If you bother me in church, I will have you removed.” There can be no other message sent!
How can the adults at that church teach the children about patience and longsuffering if they exclude children from worship for an occasional cry or whimper? I agree that excessively noisy kids should be removed—to a nursery or cry room to meet their needs. But that is a “horse of a different color” than not permitting them in worship services all together. If such is the case with children, what about adults who make excessive noise, as in coughing or sneezing too much? Are they to be denied entrance for not controlling their irritated throats and noses? To be consistent, such would have to be the case — for a coughing adult is no quieter than a toddler needing a diaper change!
If the reasoning behind keeping children out of worship is that it keeps things under control in the assembly, the people need to rethink their reasoning. They might think they are teaching the children the importance of worship by not permitting them to be in the assembly until they are quiet, but in reality it says the exact opposite. If worship is essential for Christian growth, which it is (I Corinthians 11:30; Hebrews 10:24-25), why are we not permitting them to witness and partake of it with us? How are we training them to worship God when we won’t even show them how to do it? Would we do the same with other “important” assemblies (funerals, weddings, etc.)? Even the Jews were taught to let their children see them worship so that “when your children say to you, 'What do you mean by this service?'“ they could then explain the need for worshipping God (Exodus 12:26-27). How can we do any less with a much greater covenant?
[If the matter is over “Children’s Church” in place of worship, then such would be just as wicked because godly “men” are to lead in worship (cf., I Timothy 2:8), and not children or women. Creating a separate assembly for children (or women) just for the sake of letting them have the lead in worship is just another way of resisting God’s will for women and children to be in submission to men.]
There must be a balance in the noise that takes place in the assembly. Those who are making the noise should do all they can to control it as soon as possible (I Corinthians 14:33). Those who are not making the noise must show patience and do their best to concentrate on God. The solution is not to ban small children from worship, else adults with health problems would need to be kicked out as well. Instead, our emphasis should be on the worship and praise of God, which is why we are assembled in the first place (Ephesians 5:19-20). God tells us He is a God who “is greater than our heart, and knows all things” (I John 3:20), so why should I be impatient with someone who needs 5 seconds to get their noise under control? If God can still hear our prayers, songs and praise, why should I stop offering it to Him because of a crying baby or coughing adult? Is it in keeping with God’s character to be impatient with others? Or is it in keeping with His attitude to be inconsiderate of others when we are making excessive noise? Then why should His worshippers fail to demonstrate such qualities in the most sacred assembly on earth — worship? How ironic it must be to God for people to gather in His name to worship Him (a selfless and considerate being) yet fail to extend the same attitude toward one another. Can people truly love God without showing such love to others (I John 4:20-21)?",What is the author's opinion on excluding children from worship services in church?,This question cannot be answered.,False,0,"Welcome to Church ...

19,257,"I had a short conversation with a dear friend yesterday that stuck with me all day long and through a long drive in which I listened to an audiobook of Richard Rohr’s, thereby inviting him into the conversation going on in my little ‘ol head. My friend and I had raised questions with each other about the motivation behind prayer and what prayer looks like. We talked about the in-dwelling of the Holy Spirit. Transformation vs. performance and where the former comes from, and how. Rohr’s contributions to the discussion concerned the 9 stages of Spiritual Growth (what I’ve come to label this as going from a church-goer to disciple). So with all this, I went into my prayers for the night.
Really, the crux of our exchange was about law and grace and the BOTH AND nature of these two attributes of our Abba Father found in the Word. Not either-or but both-and. We touched on the question of quantity – of how much- how much of the law was trumped once for all by Jesus? As the ultimate and final fulfilment of the law how much of what preceeded Jesus’ life on earth informs our lives and choices – our hearts and minds – on a practical, daily living, kingdom-of-heaven-is-NOW, basis. How are we transformed to the true self by anything other than grace?
Interestingly enough, the first reading from the Psalter this morning could not have been better for keeping me mindful of the overall question. Psalm 119 exposes the tension between LAW and GRACE – at least for me. Old School. New School. Old Testament. New Testament.
What I found myelf doing during the reading was subsituting – at times unconciously – ‘the law or statutes’ with the words LOVE and GRACE. For God is LOVE and by his grace we live. And here are a few of the verses that jumped out:
I’m not asserting that this is how this psalm or any of the Hebrew Scriptures should be read now that Jesus has come and died for all of us, once for all. No, rather it was just what the Spirit had me do as a way to further unpack the question my sister in Christ and I were trying to answer together.
Both-And. His Word. His truth. His love and grace. Both schools – old and new. Both-and.

24,199,"10 of the Most Common Problems You May Encounter with Your Roof
It isn’t at all uncommon for your roof to experience damage, but urn into a huge problem if it is left untreated. It can be just a minor leak, and it can create a lot of damage, especially to the interior of your home, such as ruined ceilings, wallboard and insulation. Therefore, it is very important that you take the time out of your day to regularly inspect your roof. This helps to detect minor issues long before they develop into major problems that require costly repairs. Here are 10 of the most frequent issues that you may come across with your roof:
Problem #1: The Sun.
Over time, the UV rays from the sun can result in the deterioration of your roof. This is particularly true if you have an asphalt singled roof. The asphalt shingles can dry, blister and crack, eventually coming loose and possibly falling off. If this happens, the sheathing underneath will be exposed – as will the roof – to the various weather elements.
Problem #2: Snow and Ice.
Your roof can really take a beating from snow and ice. As the build-up of snow and ice melt, the water will make its way beneath the flashing and shingles where it will eventually refreeze. When it refreezes, it will lift the flashing and shingles, allowing for more water to seep through. The cycle can then start all over again. Eventually, the flashing and shingles can come loose or you can just have bad leaks on your hands. In either case, it is important to check your roof each spring if you live in an area where snow, ice and freezing are conditions you deal with regularly.
Problem #3: Strong Gusts of Wind.
Another issue that you have is the wind, and it doesn’t mean that there has to be a strong storm coming through the area for you to deal with strong winds. You can have strong gusts of wind on a perfectly clear, sunny day, and these gusts of wind can be strong enough to either lift or tear your shingles off of your roof. So, keep an eye out on the ground for pieces or entire shingles.
Problem #4: Overhanging Tree Limbs.
Tree limbs that hang over your roof can rub against the surface of your roof causing the protective top layer of your shingles to be rubbed away. If branches were to fall onto your roof from a nearby tree, this can cause even more damage, such as puncturing a hole in your roof. So, on a regular basis, it is important to take the time to trim back tree limbs as much as possible away from your roof. If there is a roof that appears to pose a threat to the roof and your home as a whole, it is a good idea to have the entire thing removed as soon as possible.
Problem #5: Birds/Small Wildlife.
Birds and other small wildlife can do more damage to your roof than you could ever imagine. For instance, woodpeckers would make look for insects along the eaves by making holes. These holes, believe it or not, can get pretty large and the wood would be left exposed to moisture, which means that it could eventually rot. Another example would be racoons. These animals would want to try to get into attic and may try to pull up your flashing and shingles trying to get inside. Any damage that you notice from wildlife needs to be repaired immediately and you should try to figure out ways that would discourage the animals from messing with your roof.
Problem #6: Insects.
As a general rule, insects mess with the foundation of a home. However, they can do damage to your roof as well. For example, carpenter ants, termites and similar insects will chew at fascia boards and the eaves of your roof. Insects tend to be what attracts other wildlife to your roof as well. Try to eliminate the insects and you may just eliminate the wildlife problem at the same time.
Problem #7: The Flashing.
Flashing is located around vents, chimney and the edge of your roof – all of these areas can allow water to seep in for damage to develop. Around vent flashing, there is caulking, but it often dries out and shrinks. As for the edge flashing, it can become damaged when you deal with snow buildup and ice dams during the winter. Therefore, it is a good idea to try to avoid using sharp tools and avoid hammering on the flashing and to check the caulking on a regular basis so that it can be replaced before it deteriorates too bad.
Problem #8: Clogged Gutters.
If you’re going to have a gutter system on your home, you need to make sure that it works. If your gutters are broken or clogged, they can’t do their job. Water will back up and eventually seep into the roof eaves. When this happens, the wood will rot over time. Therefore, debris needs to be cleaned out on a regular basis and the gutters need to be inspected routinely for broken seams and brackets. It is recommended to consider adding a gutter guard system to keep debris out, which makes your job easier.
Problem #9: Poorly Ventilated Attic.
Your roof’s lifespan can quickly be shortened if your attic is not insulated properly. When your attic gets too hot over the summer months, the roof’s shingles “bake” from underneath. This causes them to dry out and become brittle. If the attic is too hot during the winter months, then the snow will melt at a fast pace and the water will refreeze. This continues repeatedly and causes the shingles and flashing to lift continuously.
Problem #10: Lack of Roof Maintenance.
If you fail to keep up with your roof maintenance, then you are going to have a host of problems. Most problems will start off small, such as the need to clean your clogged gutters or remove tree limbs that are hanging over your roof. However, when these issues are not corrected over a reasonable amount of time, they can result in significant roof damage. Therefore, regular inspections and routine maintenance can easily extend the lifespan of your home’s roof and also save you a considerable amount of money in the long run.

If this happens, the sheathing underneath will be exposed – as will the roof – to the various weather elements.
Problem #2: Snow and Ice.
Your roof can really take a beating from snow and ice. As the build-up of snow and ice melt, the water will make its way beneath the flashing and shingles where it will eventually refreeze. When it refreezes, it will lift the flashing and shingles, allowing for more water to seep through. The cycle can then start all over again. Eventually, the flashing and shingles can come loose or you can just have bad leaks on your hands. In either case, it is important to check your roof each spring if you live in an area where snow, ice and freezing are conditions you deal with regularly.
Problem #3: Strong Gusts of Wind.
Another issue that you have is the wind, and it doesn’t mean that there has to be a strong storm coming through the area for you to deal with strong winds. You can have strong gusts of wind on a perfectly clear, sunny day, and these gusts of wind can be strong enough to either lift or tear your shingles off of your roof. So, keep an eye out on the ground for pieces or entire shingles.
Problem #4: Overhanging Tree Limbs.
Tree limbs that hang over your roof can rub against the surface of your roof causing the protective top layer of your shingles to be rubbed away. If branches were to fall onto your roof from a nearby tree, this can cause even more damage, such as puncturing a hole in your roof. So, on a regular basis, it is important to take the time to trim back tree limbs as much as possible away from your roof. If there is a roof that appears to pose a threat to the roof and your home as a whole, it is a good idea to have the entire thing removed as soon as possible.
Problem #5: Birds/Small Wildlife.
Birds and other small wildlife can do more damage to your roof than you could ever imagine. For instance, woodpeckers would make look for insects along the eaves by making holes. These holes, believe it or not, can get pretty large and the wood would be left exposed to moisture, which means that it could eventually rot. Another example would be racoons. These animals would want to try to get into attic and may try to pull up your flashing and shingles trying to get inside. Any damage that you notice from wildlife needs to be repaired immediately and you should try to figure out ways that would discourage the animals from messing with your roof.
Problem #6: Insects.
As a general rule, insects mess with the foundation of a home. However, they can do damage to your roof as well. For example, carpenter ants, termites and similar insects will chew at fascia boards and the eaves of your roof. Insects tend to be what attracts other wildlife to your roof as well. Try to eliminate the insects and you may just eliminate the wildlife problem at the same time.
Problem #7: The Flashing.
Flashing is located around vents, chimney and the edge of your roof – all of these areas can allow water to seep in for damage to develop. Around vent flashing, there is caulking, but it often dries out and shrinks. As for the edge flashing, it can become damaged when you deal with snow buildup and ice dams during the winter. Therefore, it is a good idea to try to avoid using sharp tools and avoid hammering on the flashing and to check the caulking on a regular basis so that it can be replaced before it deteriorates too bad.
Problem #8: Clogged Gutters.
If you’re going to have a gutter system on your home, you need to make sure that it works. If your gutters are broken or clogged, they can’t do their job. Water will back up and eventually seep into the roof eaves. When this happens, the wood will rot over time. Therefore, debris needs to be cleaned out on a regular basis and the gutters need to be inspected routinely for broken seams and brackets. It is recommended to consider adding a gutter guard system to keep debris out, which makes your job easier.
Problem #9: Poorly Ventilated Attic.
Your roof’s lifespan can quickly be shortened if your attic is not insulated properly. When your attic gets too hot over the summer months, the roof’s shingles “bake” from underneath. This causes them to dry out and become brittle. If the attic is too hot during the winter months, then the snow will melt at a fast pace and the water will refreeze. This continues repeatedly and causes the shingles and flashing to lift continuously.
Problem #10: Lack of Roof Maintenance.
If you fail to keep up with your roof maintenance, then you are going to have a host of problems. Most problems will start off small, such as the need to clean your clogged gutters or remove tree limbs that are hanging over your roof. However, when these issues are not corrected over a reasonable amount of time, they can result in significant roof damage. Therefore, regular inspections and routine maintenance can easily extend the lifespan of your home’s roof and also save you a considerable amount of money in the long run.
If you would like to schedule an inspection of your roof by a team of roofing professionals or need us to look at a problem that you found during your own inspection, give us a call at C and K Roofing. What are some common problems that can damage a roof? Some common problems that can damage a roof include the sun's UV rays causing deterioration, snow and ice causing leaks, strong gusts of wind tearing off shingles, overhanging tree limbs rubbing against the roof, birds and small wildlife creating holes, insects chewing at fascia boards and eaves, faulty flashing allowing water to seep in, clogged gutters causing water backup, poorly ventilated attics causing shingles to dry out and become brittle, and lack of roof maintenance leading to significant roof damage.",1200

The cancer society is seeking “champions” who will help enroll 10 people or more apiece in April on the way to getting 500 residents from the area enrolled in a 20- to 30-year community study called Cancer Prevention Study-3.

31,336,"There are many good reasons to start DIY projects, and the advantages are multiplied when those projects become habits. Doing things on our own equates to a whole lot of savings, and that’s more money in our pockets. It also empowers us with the knowledge and experience to recognize that we indeed still have the skills to do stuff rather than simply buy stuff. Plus, DIY procedures allow us the opportunity to be more ecologically responsible than a large factory might be, and that usually means they are healthier options as well.
As the new year arrives, undoubtedly people have resolutions on their mind, and picking up some DIY routines would be a great route to go in that regard. Not only will they save us money, empower us, protect the environment, and improve our health, but it is also just plain rewarding to accomplish stuff, to say I made that, or I’m doing this because I care. So, here are some fantastic habits to focus on in the coming year.
1. Growing Food
Soon, the spring will roll around, and it’ll be the ideal time to get a garden going. Let this year be the year to try producing some food at home. Start with some easy, quick growing foods and feel the benefits of healthy, homegrown produce. This is a wonderful hobby! It provides something useful, keeps gardeners active, reduces food miles, and improves health. Whether it is container gardens, productive patios, or full-on food forests, this year — any year — is a great time to start growing food.
2. Fermenting Food
As long as growing food is on the agenda, preserving food is a great endeavor to put in the mix. There is canning, pickling, dehydrating, and freezing, but fermenting is the only preservation method that can actually improve the nutritional value of food. It happens through the probiotic bacteria that go to work in fermentation. This actually makes our guts healthier, which bolsters our immune systems. It’s super cheap and easy to do. And, it’s lots of fun!
3. (Home)making Toiletries
Sadly, the most commonly used toiletries, chemical-based deodorants and so on, are increasingly being linked to chronic diseases and disorders. They are also expensive. Fortunately, it’s very simple to make cheap, effective toiletries at home out of natural ingredients. Not only will this save DIY-ers money and benefit their health, but the environmental impact — less packaging, less reliance on petroleum products — is noteworthy, too.
4. Repurposing Stuff
Repurposing, for many, insinuates craftiness, and while this can be part of it, it doesn’t necessarily have to be all of it. Repurposing can be as simple as looking for goods — lumber, electronics, clothing, appliances, furniture, instruments, etc. — second-hand before buying new ones. For DIY-ers, this can equate to serious savings, interesting creative twists, and rewarding projects, such as building cool items out of pallets.
5. (Home)making Cleaning Products
Much like chemical-based toiletries, it turns out many of the chemical cleaners we commonly use at home are a risk to our health. The fumes can cause respiratory problems, and there are many other lingering effects. Again, the solution is simple, and with only a handful of natural items, an entire host of cleaning products can be easily whipped up to keep the house sparkling and sanitary.
6. Building Soil
For those who are looking to grow themselves a little food, or even just general garden enthusiasts, it only makes perfect sense to begin building up healthy soil by making compost. Not only will this enhance fertility in the garden, but it’ll also make good use of biodegradable trash. Instead of sending these things — food scraps, newspapers, documents, boxes, lawn trimmings, etc. — to the landfill, furthering a growing garbage problem, they can be used to make rich, healthy soil.
7. Conserving Water
It’s time we start doing our best to conserve our fresh water, and while turning off the faucet as we brush our teeth is a good thing, there are lots of good DIY projects that can save much more water. Water taps can be changed to more efficient versions. Toilet tanks can be adjusted to use less water. A lot of the kitchen graywater we create — washing vegetables, rinsing a glass, boiling pasta or potatoes — can be used to water houseplants or gardens. The ultimate DIY project would be to start converting graywater drainage into irrigation.
A matter of a little initiative, idealism, and the DIY lifestyle can have a hugely positive impact on us, our communities, and the environment. Any of these pursuits are a worthy investment of time and effort, and the outcomes are something to be proud of. That’s what everyone wants in the new year.

Not only will they save us money, empower us, protect the environment, and improve our health, but it is also just plain rewarding to accomplish stuff, to say I made that, or I’m doing this because I care. So, here are some fantastic habits to focus on in the coming year.
1. Growing Food
Soon, the spring will roll around, and it’ll be the ideal time to get a garden going. Let this year be the year to try producing some food at home. Start with some easy, quick growing foods and feel the benefits of healthy, homegrown produce. This is a wonderful hobby! It provides something useful, keeps gardeners active, reduces food miles, and improves health. Whether it is container gardens, productive patios, or full-on food forests, this year — any year — is a great time to start growing food.
2. Fermenting Food
As long as growing food is on the agenda, preserving food is a great endeavor to put in the mix. There is canning, pickling, dehydrating, and freezing, but fermenting is the only preservation method that can actually improve the nutritional value of food. It happens through the probiotic bacteria that go to work in fermentation. This actually makes our guts healthier, which bolsters our immune systems. It’s super cheap and easy to do. And, it’s lots of fun!
3. (Home)making Toiletries
Sadly, the most commonly used toiletries, chemical-based deodorants and so on, are increasingly being linked to chronic diseases and disorders. They are also expensive. Fortunately, it’s very simple to make cheap, effective toiletries at home out of natural ingredients. Not only will this save DIY-ers money and benefit their health, but the environmental impact — less packaging, less reliance on petroleum products — is noteworthy, too.
4. Repurposing Stuff
Repurposing, for many, insinuates craftiness, and while this can be part of it, it doesn’t necessarily have to be all of it. Repurposing can be as simple as looking for goods — lumber, electronics, clothing, appliances, furniture, instruments, etc. — second-hand before buying new ones. For DIY-ers, this can equate to serious savings, interesting creative twists, and rewarding projects, such as building cool items out of pallets.
5. (Home)making Cleaning Products
Much like chemical-based toiletries, it turns out many of the chemical cleaners we commonly use at home are a risk to our health. The fumes can cause respiratory problems, and there are many other lingering effects. Again, the solution is simple, and with only a handful of natural items, an entire host of cleaning products can be easily whipped up to keep the house sparkling and sanitary.
6. Building Soil
For those who are looking to grow themselves a little food, or even just general garden enthusiasts, it only makes perfect sense to begin building up healthy soil by making compost. Not only will this enhance fertility in the garden, but it’ll also make good use of biodegradable trash. Instead of sending these things — food scraps, newspapers, documents, boxes, lawn trimmings, etc. — to the landfill, furthering a growing garbage problem, they can be used to make rich, healthy soil.
7. Conserving Water
It’s time we start doing our best to conserve our fresh water, and while turning off the faucet as we brush our teeth is a good thing, there are lots of good DIY projects that can save much more water. Water taps can be changed to more efficient versions. Toilet tanks can be adjusted to use less water. A lot of the kitchen graywater we create — washing vegetables, rinsing a glass, boiling pasta or potatoes — can be used to water houseplants or gardens. The ultimate DIY project would be to start converting graywater drainage into irrigation.
A matter of a little initiative, idealism, and the DIY lifestyle can have a hugely positive impact on us, our communities, and the environment. Any of these pursuits are a worthy investment of time and effort, and the outcomes are something to be proud of. That’s what everyone wants in the new year.

MPs are to receive taxpayer-funded iPads in an attempt to modernise Parliament.One of the things most people in industry notice is that any cost saving or paper saving equipment usually costs a lot and generates more paperwork. There's also the problem that iPads are not exactly suitable office style equipment, the big advantage of a laptop is the keyboard, the onscreen keyboard the iPad uses is nowhere near as fast or as useful, so as a research tool it's less than satisfactory. Battery life is limited, doesn't support flash (no kidding) and can’t make phone calls, can’t take pictures, and the most affordable model only has WiFi.
Politicians will be able to put the tablet computers on expenses if they give up one of their old pieces of computer kit in return.
Around 350 MPs who sit in the House of Commons on select committees will be offered the devices without having to trade.
Buying an iPad for every single MP in the Commons could cost as much as £430,000 – not including monthly subscription charges to access the internet on the move.
But the House of Commons commission, led by Speaker John Bercow, insisted the move would cut costs and save paper.
There’s also no multitasking in the iPad because it uses some variant of the iPhone OS. This means you can’t listen to Spotify and browse the web at the same time. No working in Pages while making a VoIP call. And the list goes on…
And because of the closed nature of all things Apple, there’s no simple way to transfer files to and from the iPad. Why is this relevant? Well, it means all the media files will have to be synced through iTunes, which always involves conversions to the mad Apple formats. There’s no way to just drag and drop them over WiFi or using a USB Mass Storage Device.
Not to mention all the documents produced with iWork (which even deserved to be ported to the iPad). Where will those go? And while we’re in this department, how can a device coined as a “great productivity tool” lack the support for non-Apple office software (Microsoft and Openoffice).
The main problem though is that the most affordable model is very, very expensive compared to say a netbook and the money for it is coming out of our pockets, not the House of Commons or the MP's.
Essentially it's a massive waste of money to give MP's a ""cool"" iPad on the taxpayers expense, it wont improve productivity and it wont save paper as MP's wont be able to use it for the purposes it's supposedly to be used for.
They'd be much better off using their memory and a pad and paper, or if they really need facts quick, then a laptop.

33,332,"As the weather becomes colder, now seems a good time to explore how ice is captured through time-lapse. Video sequences can speedily reveal its gradual changing state and magnify subtle changes. Ice in its various forms is fascinating to watch, and therefore it is interesting to focus on how it is captured in different ways, from ice cubes melting in a glass to ice crystals rapidly developing.
With such a variety of videos featuring ice, in this blog, we have picked out a selection of time-lapse videos that capture the different stages of ice close up. Not only are these interesting, but they also show how easy it is to get hands-on with a camera – often from the comfort of your own home.
Melting ice
Time-lapse photography is an ideal way to capture the mesmerising transition between water and ice. Even something so simple as watching ice melt can be appealing. There are numerous variations on this theme. This captivating amateur short time-lapse sequence reveals a solo ice cube rapidly melting.
Whilst a simple time-lapse capturing a glassful of ice cubes thawing fixes our attention.
Other time-lapse sequences speedily show the different states of water, from ice to liquid to boiling to evaporation.
On a larger scale, there is something fascinating about watching an intricate ice sculpture gradually dissolve into an unrecognisable state.
These often amateur time-lapses capture the straightforward melting of ice. Others mess around with the concept and disorientate the viewer. In the time-lapse sequence, Unmelt, Tony Round plays around with the melting of ice and snow to create this rather unsettling timelapse where the process is played in reverse.
Adding further interest to the concept of melting he has also created a video “Ice Storm” where items frozen during an ice storm in Toronto thaw out on timelapse. We witness them unfurling from their frozen mass to their former state, and to add to the interest he also flips this process throughout the film.
Ice forming in time-lapse
Other time-lapse videos focus on the sequence of water turning into ice. Just a glass of water gradually solidifying into ice is fascinating.
Whilst the beautiful yet simple “Frostylapse” time-lapses frost and ice crystals forming on a window. Each clip is 4 to 7 hours of real-time freezing, showing the exquisite formations of frost and ice crystals. The ice crystals subtly change colour throughout filming as light and conditions differ and the types of crystals and formation speed vary with temperature. When all the clips are edited together it creates a mesmerising time-lapse sequence.
Another unusual and intriguing video is of a bubble freezing. This amateur time-lapse reveals how frost gradually coats the delicate structure.
The enthralling short time-lapse film “Shifting Time – Water and Ice” by Daniel Kelly Brown is shot in natural surrounds and focuses on multiple day-long ice formations in Colorado rivers. It captures icicles growing from freezing water, as ice crystals form the crystalline structures.
Macro and micro time-lapse
Daniel Kelly Brown also produced his “Water and Ice” video in a macro version. Having produced the original version in 4K HD, he was able to zoom in to show the growth of the ice formation in further detail.
Macro time-lapse reveals footage that is not normally visible to the naked eye. A macro lens can magnify the intricate developments of frozen matter or capture a carpet of ice crystals creeping across the screen. In this macro time-lapse video, the footage reveals moisture from the surrounding atmosphere condensing at sub-zero temperatures to almost immediately form growing dendritic ice crystals.
Whilst using specialist equipment, microscopic time-lapse can chart the detailed formation of individual ice crystals. Filmed through a microscope, this time-lapse “Snowtime” by Vyacheslav Ivanov shows the intimate details of fragile snowflakes as they form in their miraculous hexagonal forms.
Why use time-lapse?

Is it just a passing phase, is it a serious infatuation or this time, is it the real thing? If you can’t figure out whether what you’re feeling really is love, then it’s time to do a little soul searching and ask yourself these ten questions to find out what you’re really feeling:
1. Can you picture a future without him?
Whatever your plan is for the future, our first tip on how to know if you’re in love is this – ask yourself this question: is it him in every picture that you have those future plans with? If he’s there at your side in all your dreams of travel, children and even your career, then you must be getting pretty serious about this guy.
2. Can you discuss anything with him?
Do you feel comfortable opening up to him? If you feel that you can tell him anything, even your innermost fears and secrets, then you are on the right track. When you’re willing to be completely open and honest with someone and you trust them enough to tell them about the mistakes that you have made in the past, then you are probably in love. If everything you say is designed to impress him, though, then you may not be quite there yet.
3. Do you feel good about yourself when you’re with him?
Our next tip on how to know if you’re in love is this – if you are truly in love with a person, then being around them will bring out the best in you. Love means that you want to be with that person for the rest of your life, so he should make you feel like you can really achieve things and go places with him at your side.
4. Does he make you laugh?
At times, life can be tough enough without being miserable as well, so you need a bit of laughter in a relationship. If he makes you laugh and you can laugh comfortably with each other, then that shows you that you are at the same wavelength and comfortable enough in each other’s company to be in love.
5. Can you be yourself when you are with him?
Another good tip on how to know if you’re in love is this – if you are really in love, then you shouldn’t need to a put an act, when you’re around him. You should feel comfortable enough to let the true you come out. If you don’t feel relaxed enough to be yourself, then it is unlikely that this is true love.
6. Do you ever run out of things to talk about?
Everything seems interesting, fun and easy, when you are in love and when you’re talking to the love of your life about things. You can always tell, if a couple is really loved up by the way that they are always talking to each other. Awkward silences are not a sign of a loving couple.
7. Would you look after them if they were unwell?
Now be honest about this question, because it really can be a telling one. Some illnesses need a lot more care, than just mopping the brow and some soothing words, sometimes illness can be really messy! Would you look after him, when he got a flu?
8. Do his flaws still annoy you?
Another great tip on how to know if you’re in love is to ask yourself this question: does he do things that really bug you? If you love someone, then you love them wholeheartedly and that includes their little imperfections. If there are things that he does now, that really get under your skin, then you do need to ask yourself how much you love this person. It’s unlikely that you will get him to change his ways, and if it really was love, then you wouldn’t want him to change anyway.
9. Do you admire him? Are you proud of him?
Next question on how to know if you’re in love is this: are you proud to be seen with him and do you admire him? If you are, then that’s a good sign, because when you love someone you are proud of them and their achievements, and you love to show off your admiration and pride about them.
10. Do you value his opinion?
And finally, another tip on how to know if you’re in love is to find out the answer to this question: do you really care about what he thinks? You shouldn’t have to do things just to impress him, but you should care what he thinks. Love means that you want that special person in your life to be happy and you will go out of your way to make that happen, because he makes you happy too.
How do you know you love someone? Please, feel free to share your tips in the comment section below.

It’s unlikely that you will get him to change his ways, and if it really was love, then you wouldn’t want him to change anyway.
9. Do you admire him? Are you proud of him?
Next question on how to know if you’re in love is this: are you proud to be seen with him and do you admire him? If you are, then that’s a good sign, because when you love someone you are proud of them and their achievements, and you love to show off your admiration and pride about them.
10. Do you value his opinion?
And finally, another tip on how to know if you’re in love is to find out the answer to this question: do you really care about what he thinks? You shouldn’t have to do things just to impress him, but you should care what he thinks. Love means that you want that special person in your life to be happy and you will go out of your way to make that happen, because he makes you happy too.
How do you know you love someone? Please, feel free to share your tips in the comment section below.
Stay happy! What are some signs that you might be in love with someone?

Hope all is well in the world!
A little update from last time!
I really do believe with hard work, determination and a little self belief you can achieve whatever you want to do in life… dispute our situation… if you out your kind to it you will succeed.
The past few years have been up and down and don’t get me wrong I have felt some rejection but you know what I am so glad now
If this rejection didn’t happen to me I wouldn’t be so motivated to make things work for myself… I fell now I am where I am supposed to be whether I had stargarts or not…I fell I’ve found my fortay!
I love art and so believe it’s my therapy..I get lost in the colours and can’t quite believe I’m selling my work.i feel I have a purpose and have a space that is my own surrounded by metalic’s, shimmer the brightest colours and the whitest canvas’ to go and attack!!!
No matter what you want to do career wise please don’t let this disease beat you.
Yes we take longer to do things, it’s a struggle but the sense of achievement makes the hard work worth it.
The extra challenges we face I see now as and game that I have to complete!
There is and ways a way rou d things.
Forget stigmas and all the rest of it. We are equally if not more valuable to the world…. we have understanding, empathy if others … believe in yourself and push yourself
I’m only saying this as all of a sudden I find my self in a place where about a month ago I took the plunge and began renting my own art stdio space!
When I first got jt I hated the wall paper ha it qas wreck the feng shui…..I painted white emulsion over r the wallpaper ..it began peeling off …it stripped it..there was mould I cleaned and re pai Ted. ..it’s now fresh space!
I believe so much in art therapy… Honestly you could get a little art set of £10…have a go…it’s gare tee you will be sent ro a other world of distraction ha j sound mad but try it and see…. excuse the pun …
If you do I would love to see any pics…I’m really interested in how other v.i folk see …paint what you see…do anything…I’m excited!
I feel very proud! Ive been using my iPad to zoom in on animals and tried some realistic animal portraits!
According to the photos when I zoom back in onto painting they’re working g out well.
I don’t know how .. just paint what I see…I have to zoom into each part of th3 animal and scale it back down onto the page!
It proves difficult from time to time and can be disastrous but hey .God loves a tryer.Ha… And did i mention time consuming ha. I love it though…
I did not know I was a slight perfectionist but i can work on my
painting for hours until I get them right argh!
Here’s some of my latest work..

46,473,"A person’s greatness is not measured by their words, but rather by their deeds. A person’s actions are a good representation of their heart and their character. King Ahasuerus has shown his character throughout the book of Esther. He showed off his kingdom and held a 6 month long party for all of his officials, then he threw a party for the whole kingdom. During this party, he banished his wife from the kingdom because she would not do as he commanded. He chose Esther out of many women from a royal beauty contest as his queen. In Esther 2:18, during the wedding ceremony and celebration he rescinded the “taxes to the provinces and gave gifts with royal generosity.” (Esther 2:18). He allowed Haman to pass an edict that would eliminate an entire race of people, even though he was unaware of what race he was eliminating. Since King Ahasuerus could not rescind the original law, he allowed the Jews to defend themselves which resulted in the loss of at least 75,000 people. Now in Esther 10:1, the tax that he had rescinded in Esther 2:18 is being reinstituted. The meaning of this word “tax” in the original Hebrew means “forced labor.”
This encapsulated version of King Ahasuerus’s life helps us see his character. He is impetuous and does not stop to consider the consequences of his decisions. The contrast of his life is that of Mordecai’s. Mordecai raised his niece, was important in the palace of the king and when he overheard a conversation that would threaten the life of the King he reported it to the right people. He gave Esther sound advice throughout her life that showed his love for his people and his willingness to do what was needed to save the entire race of the Jews. He became second in command even though he was not a Persian, but rather from a race of captured people. As second in command, “he was great among the Jews and popular with the multitude of his brothers, for he sought the welfare of his people and spoke peace to all his people.” (Esther 10:3).
The character of Haman also speaks for itself as he plotted the murder of an entire race of people because one man did not bow down to him. This anti-Semitist attitude evidently had permeated the entire Persian culture. According to Esther 9, there were 75,000 people who were killed because they hated the Jews and sought “to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate them.” (Esther 3:13). There is no record of any Jews being slain during this time of personal vendetta. “Now the rest of the Jews who were in the King’s provinces also gathered to defend their lives, and got relief from their enemies and killed 75, 000 of those who hated them…” (Esther 9:16). If a person did not hate and decide to attack the Jews they were safe from destruction. An edict against the entire race of the Jews to kill them was not enough personal satisfaction for Haman since he also had gallows 75 feet tall constructed to hang Mordecai on, the apparent root of his hatred and bitterness.
Esther’s character also shines through the events recorded about her life. She is raised by her uncle so at some point in her life she had to deal with the loss of her parents. She becomes part of this royal beauty pageant and wins. Though she is not a Persian, she becomes queen. Just another fact about King Ahasuerus. He does not do a background check on the new Queen but takes her as his wife based on her looks. Esther does as her Uncle Mordecai suggests and she willingly lays down her life for her people, since she does not know the response she will receive from the King since she had not seen him for 33 days. By the end of the book, the King is coming to Esther and asking her what she wants to happen. (Esther 9:12)
God takes the character of people and uses it for His purposes and plans. The theme of Esther and the central verse of the book is Esther 4:14 “…And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”

47,76,"If an Englishman’s home is his castle, his family home is undoubtedly his Buckingham Palace. They’re unimaginably precious to us, holding our memories and identities, biro-drawn height charts, and idiosyncrasies that estate agents can’t begin to appreciate the value of. This, of course, makes the prospect of selling all the harder. So what do you need to consider when selling? We’d start by doing the following…
1. Detach and de-sentimentalise. First, and foremost, practise a bit of emotional detachment: consider it the ultimate in decluttering. By letting go of material possessions (in this case, almost all of them at once and the brickwork, oak floors and Farrow and Ball paint too), you can free yourself for new adventures and space for new memories. It’s hard to walk around the rooms our children grew up in and see them as little more than selling points, but removing the romanticism will help you to start a new chapter.
2. Persuade your family members to do the same. You might be surprised (or not, depending on how vocal your offspring usually are) to find that grown up children are the most resistant to selling the family home… the very walls hold a great deal of power over kids who have flown the nest, even if they now have children themselves. Throughout tumultuous break ups, career moves and milestones, the building and its contents (and you within it) has been their one constant point of reference. Give everyone plenty of time to come around to the idea, and warn them when professional photos and for sale signs are going up: it will come as less of a shock.
3. Decide how you’re going to sell it, and to whom. How are you going to make a sale? Will you enlist the services of We Buy Any House, or offer it to the highest bidder at an auction? Would you feel most comfortable using an estate agent, or would you prefer to make a sale via a private agreement? Decide on the hows and whos of selling, as this will help to make handing over the deeds feel like the right decision.
4. Have an interim plan. Doubtless you’re on the precipice of change: be it travelling, downsizing or renting. Make sure you have somewhere to go and a way of funding your lifestyle until you’re settled into your new normal. Sales can take a while and things can get expensive if events don’t unfold as you’re expecting, so have a back up plan and a place to stay.
5. Be clear about what you want for the future. It’s no good selling if it feels like a poor exchange, so before you put it on the market, be very clear about what you want your next place to look like. Where will it be? How big is it? What input does it require from you to make it feel like it’s yours? Who will visit? How will it fit into your life going forward? Write a list of answers responding to questions like these. If you feel happy about where you end up next, you’ll feel more at peace about selling your family home to someone else.

My 10-year-old daughter has already told us that she’s never leaving home and if we want to move when she’s older, she’s buying this house.
Good to know we’ve got a buyer in the future!!
My kids have said similar too but I think they’d want us to give it to them…. No chance!!
Some good tips. My adcice would be don’t sell to some mad woman who wants to sign on lucky days – there wasn’t one for weeks.
What a ‘mare! I wonder what made the date lucky?!
In a way I am glad we are in a rental property but I would like to own a property in the future. Will keep these selling tips in mind
I can imagine it would be such a difficult process to go though, these are really helpful tips!
I found buying and selling a house one of the most stressful things ever! Not down to us, but once you get solicitors involved, well then it starts to go downhill!
Good tips. We tried selling, but no one wanted our house :/ seems 2 bedroom properties aren’t what people want in my area. We’re now renovating to make the house nice – I really don’t like it here, but hope that a re-do will spark some kind of love for it.
Ooh yeah, I definitely found it odd when my parents sold the house I grew up in – it meant their next house was ‘my parents house’ rather than home – it was a long time ago, but at the time I found it really sad!
I love moving house but my husband says we have to stay where we are for a good few years after four house moves in about 8 years x
Great tips! I hope I never have to move house again! It was the most stressful thing I have ever done.
It was for me too but it was 15 years ago now so the memory has faded somewhat!

It’s hard to walk around the rooms our children grew up in and see them as little more than selling points, but removing the romanticism will help you to start a new chapter.
2. Persuade your family members to do the same. You might be surprised (or not, depending on how vocal your offspring usually are) to find that grown up children are the most resistant to selling the family home… the very walls hold a great deal of power over kids who have flown the nest, even if they now have children themselves. Throughout tumultuous break ups, career moves and milestones, the building and its contents (and you within it) has been their one constant point of reference. Give everyone plenty of time to come around to the idea, and warn them when professional photos and for sale signs are going up: it will come as less of a shock.
3. Decide how you’re going to sell it, and to whom. How are you going to make a sale? Will you enlist the services of We Buy Any House, or offer it to the highest bidder at an auction? Would you feel most comfortable using an estate agent, or would you prefer to make a sale via a private agreement? Decide on the hows and whos of selling, as this will help to make handing over the deeds feel like the right decision.
4. Have an interim plan. Doubtless you’re on the precipice of change: be it travelling, downsizing or renting. Make sure you have somewhere to go and a way of funding your lifestyle until you’re settled into your new normal. Sales can take a while and things can get expensive if events don’t unfold as you’re expecting, so have a back up plan and a place to stay.
5. Be clear about what you want for the future. It’s no good selling if it feels like a poor exchange, so before you put it on the market, be very clear about what you want your next place to look like. Where will it be? How big is it? What input does it require from you to make it feel like it’s yours? Who will visit? How will it fit into your life going forward? Write a list of answers responding to questions like these. If you feel happy about where you end up next, you’ll feel more at peace about selling your family home to someone else.

My 10-year-old daughter has already told us that she’s never leaving home and if we want to move when she’s older, she’s buying this house.
Good to know we’ve got a buyer in the future!!
My kids have said similar too but I think they’d want us to give it to them…. No chance!!
Some good tips. My adcice would be don’t sell to some mad woman who wants to sign on lucky days – there wasn’t one for weeks.
What a ‘mare! I wonder what made the date lucky?!
In a way I am glad we are in a rental property but I would like to own a property in the future. Will keep these selling tips in mind
I can imagine it would be such a difficult process to go though, these are really helpful tips!
I found buying and selling a house one of the most stressful things ever! Not down to us, but once you get solicitors involved, well then it starts to go downhill!
Good tips. We tried selling, but no one wanted our house :/ seems 2 bedroom properties aren’t what people want in my area. We’re now renovating to make the house nice – I really don’t like it here, but hope that a re-do will spark some kind of love for it.
Ooh yeah, I definitely found it odd when my parents sold the house I grew up in – it meant their next house was ‘my parents house’ rather than home – it was a long time ago, but at the time I found it really sad!
I love moving house but my husband says we have to stay where we are for a good few years after four house moves in about 8 years x
Great tips! I hope I never have to move house again! It was the most stressful thing I have ever done.
It was for me too but it was 15 years ago now so the memory has faded somewhat!
Thanks for the tips – I’ve never sold a house before but I think I would be a little more confident on where to start now! What is the author's daughter's plan regarding their current house? This question cannot be answered.",933

49,218,"a classic and therefore enjoy without a second thought. However, a closer look into these rock hits reveals the hidden meaning behind why the lyrics were written and what hidden messages the artists are trying to communicate.
Here are five influential pieces that take a little digging to fully understand the hidden messages in the songs:
“Total Eclipse of the Heart” – Bonnie Tyler
Upon first listen, “Total Eclipse of the Heart” comes off as an emotionally charged love song. What most listeners don’t know is that it was originally written as a vampire love song and was featured in Jim Steinman’s Broadway musical, Dance of the Vampires.
When you listen closely, lyrics like “Once upon a time there was light in my life, but now there’s only love in the dark” lend themselves to a more cryptic theme. Although the song never outright mentions vampires or coffins, the tones of the song make sense for use in the musical. Despite its roots, this rock music meaning is widely known as a love song (for mortals).
“London Calling” – The Clash
Often interpreted as a politically charged anthem about the British government, “London Calling” was actually inspired by Joe Strummer’s fear of drowning. At the time of the song’s creation, headlines warning Londoners about the flooding of the Thames river sparked fear – and inspiration – in the band.
Lyrics like “The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in. Meltdown expected, the wheat is growin’ thin. Engines stop running, but I have no fear ’cause London is drowning, and I, I live by the river” portray the warning as the start of the end of the world. Mick Jones explains that while the song was inspired by Strummer’s fear of drowning, it unfolded into a general warning of doom.
“Hey Jude” – The Beatles
This Beatles hit was written by Paul McCartney shortly after John Lennon’s divorce from his wife, Cynthia. Lennon’s son, Julian, who was five at the time, was having a rough time accepting his parent’s divorce. McCartney was close to the family and developed a special relationship with Julian, who he empathized with. He began singing “Hey Jules…” to himself and wrote the original draft of “Hey Jude” as a gesture of comfort for Julian.
He later expanded the lyrics and changed the name in the song to “Jude” to fit his style. Lines like “And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain, don’t carry the world upon your shoulders” depict the comforting tone that McCartney was trying to communicate. It wasn’t until 20 years later that Julian discovered the song was originally created for him.
“American Pie” – Don McLean
While the upbeat pace and catchy lines of this song sound like a cheerful anthem of American youth, it was actually written as a goodbye to an era. In 1959, Buddy Holly, along with several other musical superstars, boarded a plane that tragically crashed, killing everyone aboard. This rocked the music world and inspired Don McLean to write “American Pie” in 1972.
Lyrics like “The day the music died” are in reference to that fatal plane crash, which symbolizes the loss of the romance and idyll that characterized the fifties and sixties. In short, the song illustrates the departure of the American dream in a way that is simultaneously light and comforting.
“Hotel California” – The Eagles
This mellow, catchy hit seems like a west-coast-vacation-inspired ballad, but upon closer inspection, the lyrics are actually calling out excess in America. The song depicts the high life in LA as interpreted by Glenn Frey, Don Henley, and Don Felder. Lyrics like “They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can’t kill the beast” and “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave!” expose the darker side of an extravagant LA lifestyle. In the 2013 History of the Eagles documentary, Don Henley explained, “It’s a song about a journey from innocence to experience.”
Whether it’s a political statement decorated with a cheerful chorus or a personal message of comfort embedded in a chart-topping classic, hidden messages in songs add depth to the artist’s work. Often times, song inspiration sparks from societal events, personal struggles and triumphs, cultural nostalgia, or opinions of the artist.

Mr Qureshi was reinstated in the FIA after the Supreme Court suspended on Friday the notification regarding his transfer to the National Police Foundation.

Besides, all the witnesses have been testified and an acquittal application has already been filed,” he said. Mr. Agha said the PML-Q also smelt a rat in the move as it seemed “some hidden hands in the government are on the agenda of irritating the judiciary in Moonis’ case to achieve their vested interests.” According to an FIA official, some eight officials were transferred on Saturday. “There has been no standing direction from the apex court to transfer the officials in question,” he said. After Mr Qureshi’s return to the FIA, a PPP’s federal minister may be in trouble for his alleged share in the scam. According to sources, the minister in question has received Rs200 million in the NICL land deal in Dubai. PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif has publically called action against Commerce Minister Amin Fahim for his alleged involvement in the NICL scam.

Autism; Challenging; Behaviors; Mirtazapine; Galantamine
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are associated with a host of challenging behaviors that constitute a focus of clinical attention and a target for psychopharmacologic interventions [1]. Only Risperidone and Aripiprazole are FDA-approved to address these behavioral facets once psychological and educational approaches (e.g. Applied Behavioral Analysis, Sensory Integration) are ineffective, inaccessible, or, unaffordable [2]. Moreover, no single drug is currently approved to alter core symptoms of ASD. These behaviors include, inter alia, ADHD-like symptoms, tics and stereotypies, auto- and hetero-aggression, irritability and mood and anxiety symptoms, disturbed eating and sleeping patterns, and sexually-inappropriate behaviors [1].
Unfortunately, the use of these atypical antipsychotics is fraught with a multitude of cardio-metabolic and neurologic syndromes [3]. This calls for novel psychotropic agents that are both effective and tolerable.
Mirtazapine is atypical antidepressant with unique mechanism of action, namely; Noradrenergic-Specific Serotonergic Antidepressant (NaSSA); blocking α2 auto&hetero-receptors, thus increasing norepinephrine, also blocking 5HT2&3 receptors, as well as H1 receptors.
Galantamine is anti-dementia specific acetylcholinestrase inhibitor (AchE-i) and allosteric ligand at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR).
Here, we are reporting on a case of an adolescent with ASD, where ‘Mirtazapine-Galantamine cocktail’ brought about a significant improvement in the behavioral domains and strikingly, hit some of the core social features. This was achieved with great tolerability.
A 14-year-old Kuwaiti youngster, eldest of five sibs, a product of elective Caesarean Section, emanating from a consanguineous monogamous family, attending special schooling, long diagnosed as ASD/ID (Intellectual Disability)/Epilepsy, maintained on Valproate for seizure control, was escorted by his parents for escalating behavioral dyscontrol, notably irritability, aggression, hyperactivity, fitful sleep and socially flouting over sexualized behaviors. Medical and environmental causation of this behavioral decompensation were meticulously ruled out. He couldn’t tolerate a trial on Risperidone where he developed recurrent torticollis and oculogyric crisis. He failed a 6-week trial on 15 mg/d Aripiprazole. Clonidine was also tried at 300 µg/d but prematurely aborted for severe hypotension (80/50) and symptomatic bradycardia (50/min). Atomoxetine, for hyperactivity was instituted, uptitrated to 40 mg/d over 8 weeks, but, without clinically meaningful response. Ecitalopram at 10 mg/d, for 4 weeks, was introduced for aggression, but to no avail. We suggested a trial with Mirtazapine as data from the literature support its use for sexually-inappropriate behaviors in ASD, and also to help with sleep and irritability. We went to 45 mg/d over 4 weeks. Sleep improved markedly, irritability diminished significantly and most importantly, sexual behaviors were greatly tamed. Both frequency and severity of aggression became obviously less. This was well-sustained at follow-ups W-6, 8, and 12. We, then, opined to embark on a trial of Galantamine, as burgeoning evidence from literature favors its use for both core and behavioral symptom sets of ASD. We dosed it at 8 mg/d for 4 weeks, then up to 16 mg/d (in 2 divided doses). Strikingly, hyperactivity noticeably decreased, but, most importantly, better eye contact, vocalizations, gestures and social relatedness were observed. This was plateaued at follow-ups W-6, 8, and 12. No pharmacokinetic drug interactions reported with this combination. No side effects, of significance, were noted. These findings were objectified on Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABCL) and Krug’s Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). Medications Chart is portrayed in table (1).
Table 1: Medication Chart.
These promising results concords with those demonstrated in a naturalistic open-label study of mirtazapine in ASD where almost a third of subjects showed improvement across different domains including aggression, self-injury, irritability, hyperactivity, anxiety, depression, and, insomnia [4].
Anti-libidinal properties of mirtazapine helped sexually-inappropriate behaviors in ASD [5-6].
Cholinergic stimulation of central serotonergic subsystem with galantamine may enhance language and communication in autistic adults as shown in three cases [7]. A prospective open-label trial of galantamine in ASD showed it was well-tolerated and beneficial for interfering behaviors, particularly aggression, behavioral dyscontrol and inattention [8]. Recently, an RCT showed galantamine was effective and safe augmentative strategy for alleviating some of autism-related symptoms [9].
Such data accrue to open new venues of psychopharmacologic interventions in ASD that are both effective and well-tolerated.

Northwestern Routs UNC for 21-7 for 5th Consecutive NCAA Title.
The Wildcats celebrates their championship with their well-earned trophy. The Northwestern Wildcats routes the North Carolina Tar Heels 21-7 to capture their 5th consecutive National Championship at Johnny Unitas Stadium on May 24, 2009. Yuchen Nie/DC Sports Box
TOWSON, MD--Before the season even started, Hannah Nielsen, Northwestern’s star senior midfielder, joked with her teammates that the only thing that these seniors haven’t done in their star-studded career was to go undefeated. During the season though, the idea that they would go undefeated stayed strong with the team despite facing major obstacles, one of which included attack/midfielder Hilary Bowen tearing her ACL a little over a month ago. Rather than calling it quits for the rest of the season, Bowen, one of the best finishers in the country, wrapped her knee with bandages and a custom brace for every game and finished with five goals in the championship game.
In the semi-final game against Penn, the Wildcats struggled with shooting the ball and allowed the Penn Quakers to come back and tie it before the end of regulation. Then, if it were not for Katrina Dowd’s behind-the-back goal with less than a second remaining, the Wildcats may have never had a chance to reach the finals. This game however, the Wildcats focused on taking quality shots and implementing their full-field pressure defense.
Northwestern got off to a quick start by scoring two goals from Hilary Bowen and Mary Kate Casey to go up 2-0 in under three minutes. Then after four minutes of play, Megan Bosica drew a penalty within the 8-meter for a free-position shot. Bosica converted only to have Danielle Spencer slash through the Carolina defense minutes later to put Northwestern up by two goals.
On the ensuing draw, Danielle Spencer used their height advantage to snatch the ball out of the air and quickly dished it to Brooke Matthews, who is the fastest person on Northwestern’s squad. Matthews took less than 12 seconds to run from midfield to the opposing goal and fired a shot past Carolina goalie Logan Ripely to put the Wildcats up three. However, on the next possession, Cory Donohue would score on a free-position shot to cut the lead to two. Just when Carolina seem to have gotten comfortable with their opponent, the Tar Heels suddenly collapsed allowing Northwestern to go on a ridiculous 10-goal run in the last twenty minutes of the first half to put the game away. Carolina had absolutely no response to the onslaught of goals and struggled to even keep their heads up to fight off the frustration.
During this run, most of the goals scored were either done by dodging to the goal or Hannah Nielsen feeding from behind the net to one of their cutters. In fact, Hannah Nielsen would finish with no goals, but an eye-popping six assists as the Northwestern squad lit up the stats sheet. Also, the most impressive fact with the Wildcat’s first half run was that they scored 15 goals on only 17 shots meaning that almost all their shots were at point-blank range right in front of the cage.
In the second half, Northwestern continued their dominance by scoring the first four goals including two unassisted goals from Danielle Spencer. Spencer, who is listed at 6-2, used her size and surprising quickness to muscle her way to the cage, and she finished with four goals (all of them were unassisted) and an assist.
Finally, with the last 15 minutes of the game, Coach Hiller eased the offensive pressure and elected to play a game of keep-away for the remaining minutes under mercy-rule.
With this win, Northwestern wins their fifth consecutive national championship making them the second team in history to win five straight, and only two more short of Maryland’s seven-year championship record. Also, Coach Hiller has a winning percentage well above 95% giving her the NCAA record for the highest postseason winning percentage.",Who scored the first two goals for Northwestern in the championship game against North Carolina Tar Heels?,Hilary Bowen and Mary Kate Casey scored the first two goals for Northwestern in the championship game against North Carolina Tar Heels.,False,0,"

62,613,"To all the concerned activists of Green Girl world
Yesterday I was sent an email from an old friend. The email was nearly frantic about a new bill being introduced into the legislature. Although I was in that moment seriously disturbed, I also felt compelled to do more research. I have my organizations I hold with great respect, and the initial source for this information was not one of them.
Photo by: Modest & Jill
I am a huge advocate of taking action. I say let’s get political, make calls, and speak up! However, we cannot be alarmists. I’ve definitely been one before and I felt like an idiot. Don’t be that person; it’s not fun. So, we just need to check our sources or do a cross check especially when something doesn’t feel right. Before making a decision on your action. Let’s not become an ignorant mob when people decide to play on our fears (which is what a lot of internet hype is doing right now). On this particular issue I personally feel more disarmed after doing some research.
So what was all the concern over? It was in reference to HR 875 a bill called the Food Safety Modernization Act. It seems the bill was introduced by the Democratic Senator of Connecticut, Rosa DeLauro, and not written by Monsanto as the hysteria on the internet is suggesting. The concern was that this could put small organic farmers out of business and the ""food police"" could come arrest you for an organic garden in your backyard. As I had mentioned before, when I first got the email I felt outraged immediately but I had a weird feeling about it since this just seemed too outrageous and very strange that I had not heard anything from what I consider credible sources.
There is a consumer group called Food and Water Watch. I actively participate in signing their petitions and I found it odd that they did not send out a warning to me. If they felt it had interests of Agribusiness in mind, they would send out a warning. I also feel that RAN (the Rainforest Action Network) would have sent something out as well since they are active in all issues pertaining to gross corporate power and I have received petitions by them in regards to the giants of Agribusiness.
- Food and Water watch has created a fact sheet that is available on their site
- You can also read the opinion of FactCheck.org
- To read the bill you can go to GovTrack
I will be the first to say that I would not put anything past big Agribusiness to be pulling shenanigans, however, I feel there are organizations devoted to being our watchdog. Food and Water Watch dedicates their entire day to making sure we know what is going on behind the scenes on the food and water safety fronts, and they have not red flagged this legislation. If they had, I would have received an email from them calling upon their e-newsletter troops to sign a petition. I would still encourage people to call their Senators to voice their opinions or try to get more information, however, I am feeling today that this could be helpful legislation but like many things may need some more tweaking.
Before making decisions in general, I would recommend taking a moment for some deep breathing, calming yourself down, centering yourself for maybe a short meditation. When you are done, take another minute to let the feeling of peace around you linger a moment longer so you can appreciate it. Allocate some time to do some background work on whatever important issue you want to make a decision on while attempting to maintain your peace and not let stress and worry creep back in. Start to think from this centered place and realize we have the ability to change things in our life if only we speak up and act.
To be a responsible greenie we do have to realize that we need to be active, we need to be political. We should be thankful that we are in a country are allowed an opinion on public matters in the first place. It's a great privilege to be able to vote and we should see taking a stand on issues by petitions or by voting not as a burden but as an honor to protect our beautiful world.

- Food and Water watch has created a fact sheet that is available on their site
- You can also read the opinion of FactCheck.org
- To read the bill you can go to GovTrack
I will be the first to say that I would not put anything past big Agribusiness to be pulling shenanigans, however, I feel there are organizations devoted to being our watchdog. Food and Water Watch dedicates their entire day to making sure we know what is going on behind the scenes on the food and water safety fronts, and they have not red flagged this legislation. If they had, I would have received an email from them calling upon their e-newsletter troops to sign a petition. I would still encourage people to call their Senators to voice their opinions or try to get more information, however, I am feeling today that this could be helpful legislation but like many things may need some more tweaking.
Before making decisions in general, I would recommend taking a moment for some deep breathing, calming yourself down, centering yourself for maybe a short meditation. When you are done, take another minute to let the feeling of peace around you linger a moment longer so you can appreciate it. Allocate some time to do some background work on whatever important issue you want to make a decision on while attempting to maintain your peace and not let stress and worry creep back in. Start to think from this centered place and realize we have the ability to change things in our life if only we speak up and act.
To be a responsible greenie we do have to realize that we need to be active, we need to be political. We should be thankful that we are in a country are allowed an opinion on public matters in the first place. It's a great privilege to be able to vote and we should see taking a stand on issues by petitions or by voting not as a burden but as an honor to protect our beautiful world.

66,588,"I am trying to update an older cinder project (0.8.3) and move from running 3 screens with a Matrox to running 3 screens with one computer. Looking at the multi window it seems fairly easy to spawn three windows all fullscreen and I assume assign them to different screens? Second question is if I can setup one 3D scene and have each screen render it from a different camera so I can then project the three as one seamless view? I am trying to determine feasibility before diving in so any advice is deeply appreciated.
Multiwindow, same scene but different cameras?
What’s the graphics card? You’ll have a much simpler time if you can manage to use the drivers to make a virtual desktop that spans multiple displays. I’ve been using NVidia Mosaic for this, which requires something in the Quadro series, but I believe there is something similar with GTX cards too (Surround, maybe?).
Other than that, you can also manually size just one window to span all three displays, and make it borderless, but this doesn’t work near as nice as a fullscreen app with one window.
If you have multiple windows, you’ll have multiple gl contexts, so handling resources across the three of them becomes more complicated.
cheers,
Rich
Thank you for the feedback! I am trying to pull this off on an early 2013 MBP with an NVIDIA GT 650M. On top of that, MacOS is going to limit the use of the good drivers.
This is the route I will try, but why do you say this is not as nice?
What about the tactic of rendering to one large FBO and then each display/window uses a piece of it?
Hi,
I have been away from Cinder for a while, busy with other stuff, so forgive me in advance if it’s not working, but I have a sample that does what you want:
At the very least, you could have a look at it for ideas. It’s pretty easy to render the same scene in multiple windows, but you’ll have to understand that you’re going to do the same work multiple times and performance will be an issue. Make sure to draw the least amount of polygons by performing culling where possible. I don’t think culling is part of the sample, but you’ll find some culling code in the samples that come with Cinder. Let us here on the forum know if you have more questions.

Fbo first, then copying the correct portion to each window. The solution in the sample above should actually be your last resort. But it might be of interest nonetheless.
Problem with rendering to a single
Fbo first is that it requires more memory and, additionally, you can’t share the
Fbo across each of the window’s graphic contexts. However, you can share the actual texture used by the
Fbo.

Could this data prove useful? Politicians use this data to determine where to campaign and where a certain percentage of voters typically live.

73,203,"What is Testing?
In the software development life cycle, we find that testing is an important and integral part. Most people are of the view that testing phase can only be initiated for testing once the code is ready. They are wrong!!!
Testing will in fact be initiated from the requirements gathering phase until the stage when the product goes live. i.e. into production.
Let’s see the set of documents that aid testing during the various phases of software development.
With the onus on testing to deliver quality products, it became necessary to have a set of documents that are manageable and make sense to the development community. In comes various tools that will aid the testing and development community to track these documents. These tools manage all the testing activities and provide different kinds of reports.
The most prominent one of these tools is the Quality Center.
Visible advantages of using Quality Center
1) Analyzes the progress of the testing activity.
- It is illustrated in terms of percentages for the Pass/ Fail scenarios.
2) Aids management to analyze and take future steps accordingly.
What is Quality Center?
It is a web based application that enables and provides visibility and traceability to the entire testing process from the requirements to the test result analysis.
Features of Quality Center
1) Primary a Test Management Tool.
2) It provides/ offers an organized framework for testing applications.
3) Helps in organizing various test documents and managing all phases of application testing process (This step also includes testing requirement specifications, Test Plans). The activities that are supported are creating test requirements, planning for tests, execution of tests, and tracking related defects.
The main advantage is the ability to integrate all the tasks involved in testing (for application), hence we derive the maximum benefit of the best quality products.
4) Ability to access your testing assets anytime, anywhere via a browser interface. (Accessibility is provided by means of username, password).
5) Ability to create an end-to-end quality management infrastructure
The Quality Management infrastructure necessarily means
- Requirements
- TEst Cases
- Test Results
- Test Analysis Reports
6) Manage manual and automated tests.
- Manual tests can be accessed by opening the script and testing the same. Results are provided manually.
- Automated test scripts can be referenced and the outcome can be indicated based on the outcome of the script result.
7) Analyze application readiness at any point in the testing process with integrated graphs and reports.
Requirements in Quality Center?
What are requirements?
According to the definition, the requirements includes all those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product, taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders, such as beneficiaries or users. In short, this is what the client ultimately wants.
Requirements can be stated in any of the following forms
- SRS – System Requirement Specifications
- URS – Users Requirement Specifications.
Requirements can be added by selecting Requirements from the left panel.
Test Plans
It is a facility through which the user will be able to add test cases, arrange and categorize those test cases, based on need.
What is required for inserting/ creating test cases into Quality Center?
1) In orderr to add the relevant test cases into QC, we need to create testcases in the format typical for QC update (compatible to QC).
2) The test case is identified by three (3) parameters
- Subject (The details indicated under the SUBJECT will enable QC to segregate based on the first level hierarchy. E.g. It may well be your client name say “Client1”). Client1\Regression\Phase2
- TestName (Will consider the last level in the hierarchy to classify and store the related test cases. E.g. It may be a test scenario called “Offline”). Client1\Regression\Phase2\User Access
- Description (Will be an inherent part of the test case and will be visible when the user opens the test case through the test lab.
Example of a description column entry
- Objective : Verifying the Login feature to the application.
- Username : admin
- Password : n13da
- Precondition : The user should have invoked the application on any of the browsers IE7, IE8, FireFox, Google Chrome.
- Remarks (if any) :
How are test cases written?
a) Test cases are written in Excel in the format indicated below.
- Subject
- TestName
- Description
- StepName
- Step Description
- Expected Result
- Designer
- TestCase Status
- Priority
b) The “TestCase Status” column will have the entry “Design” which is later change to “Ready to Execute”.
c) Test cases are always written in Excel and later uploaded into QC.
d) As seen in the figure earlier, the Subject and TestName will identify the level of the test case.
e) Ensure that the StepName is written sequentially as “Step 0”, “Step 1”, …
f) The Description contains
- Objective
- User details
- PreCondition

Software Testing
Please let me know some unique features of QC apart from the basic flow.
Hi Andy,
QC is an application that will enable the testers and the management to
1) Track the execution of the test cases which are arranged and ordered in test suites.
2) Enable the management to arrive at specific information from the metrics provided within QC.
3) Enable the testers to effectively test and trace each and every test case within QC.
4) Makes the testers job easier since it enables tracing from requirements to test suites/ test cases to defects. Defect ID in the form of URL from a defect tracking application can be copied and saved for each test case so that traceability exist when the user wants to know the reason for failure.
This blog is very useful. I want to know how to get a report of test cases wrote by a feature/folder and by a QA tester from QC 11 Test plan.
Thanks

In the software development life cycle, we find that testing is an important and integral part. Most people are of the view that testing phase can only be initiated for testing once the code is ready. They are wrong!!!
Testing will in fact be initiated from the requirements gathering phase until the stage when the product goes live. i.e. into production.
Let’s see the set of documents that aid testing during the various phases of software development.
With the onus on testing to deliver quality products, it became necessary to have a set of documents that are manageable and make sense to the development community. In comes various tools that will aid the testing and development community to track these documents. These tools manage all the testing activities and provide different kinds of reports.
The most prominent one of these tools is the Quality Center.
Visible advantages of using Quality Center
1) Analyzes the progress of the testing activity.
- It is illustrated in terms of percentages for the Pass/ Fail scenarios.
2) Aids management to analyze and take future steps accordingly.

The ""tier 2"" option, school officials have said, would preserve existing programs and services, while the other options would require layoffs and other cuts.
""I'm going to recommend to the school committee tonight to adopt the full budget request knowing this is a starting point for our communities and that over the course of the next couple of months we're going to be working to provide an adequate budget that can be funded by the communities but can also provide what we need here as a school community to effectively educate our children,"" said interim Superintendent Dr. Jessica Huizenga.
Before taking a vote, Chairman David Goodfellow invited discussion by committee members pertaining to the number.
""I guess I'll be blunt,"" said committee member John Olivieri, ""I've heard on a couple occasions ... why, if we know that this is 'just a starting point', are we even going to use that number? In all reality we know right now that the communities are not going to be able to support this.""
Mr. Olivieri said he was in favor of the tier 2 budget in terms of what it provides educationally, but he said he does not think the voted number will stand.
""Obviously we have to vote a budget number,"" said Mr. Goodfellow, noting that the state aid number is still up in the air, as is what the towns will be able to afford. "" I share your frustration. I wish we had the answers we really need — they're just not here yet.""
Committee member Derek Gracia pointed out that low class size was the number one priority when the two towns agreed to fully regionalize.
""At a minimum we have to deliver that ... Anything below that fails miserably,"" he said.
""We kind of come to a point in our budget cycle over the last 2 years where our costs are just far exceeding what our revenue is,"" said Dr. Huizenga. ""And John, to your point, I think the towns have made very clear that even our base budget is going to require an override ... When you're at that point where that base budget is going to have class sizes exceeding 30 from K-12 it puts us in an interesting quandary where yes, there's no line drawn in the sand but we're kind of at a point in our system ... where something has to be done and so my question is ... why not go to the public and ask for the educational program we feel we can best deliver on the future of their kids?""
Mr. Olivieri argued that a more realistic number of what the towns would be willing to pay would be better to support.
""A number of folks have told me that Freetown doesn't even want to put the ballot out there to have an override, so what does that do?"" Said Mr. Olivieri. ""I'm more interested in focusing down and getting as close to what is realistic as we can as opposed to going through this process that just drags out and causes a lot of angst for people.""
Committee member Robert Noguiera argued that the voters in Freetown can get 10 signatures together to have a warrant article put on the town meeting warrant by petition if the elected officials are against allowing the voters to have their say with an override.
The motion to accept $33.7 million as the initial budget number was approved by majority vote.
Following the budget vote, the school committee discussed the district's next move concerning its superintendent-dilemma as a cancelled search has left them without a permanent replacement for Dr. Huizenga.
Massachusetts Association of School Committees representative and liaison to the district throughout the search process Glenn Koocher provided Mr. Goodfellow with a list of 62 names of potential candidates including retired superintendents to serve as interim while the district waits for the search process to reboot.
The committee decided to assign Mr. Goodfellow and Vice Chairman Robert Clark to interview a selection of candidates and ultimately determining the one who will be hired as interim. Their findings are to be presented at the next school committee meeting. which was to be held last night.

85,547,"10 good reasons for using jquery as your javascript framework
I'm a jquery lover - I admit. ever since I started using this excellent framework - I got hooked. Since I'm consider myself a core javascript developer, I tend to test and research before I choose to use others work. Well - Jquery has passed the test! Nowadays, when developing in javascript, a developer has to be able to code for all browsers at least (in my opinion and as a proof of concept from our reality). It's one of the most common requirements a javascript project must take into an account when developing any project. The browsers market is changing and people are getting to know few browsers and tend to prefer one over the other. There are many good reasons for why using jquery as your javascript framework.
After working for quite some time with jquery in big and small projects, these are my top reasons:
10 Good Reasons for using Jquery as your Javascript framework
- Easy to use if you have a hidden element (of any kind - li, div, td, etc) - in order to show it, it's ""display"" property has to set the its proper ""block"" state. Each element has its own native ""block"" state. Jquery does that simply with the show() method: $('div').show(). So - if it's a ""td"" element, in modern browsers (such as firefox, chrome, webkit etc..) this method will set its display property to ""table-cell"".
- Performance Jquery uses a document fragment for some inner dom processing - which results in faster dom manipulations such as: appending html content, removing elements etc.
- CSS (xpath) selector syntax to retrieve elements one of the most common actions in jquery is to get a set of elements (or one element) and perform one or more actions on it. Jquery uses the sizzle engine to retrieve dom elements. Sizzle uses the convenient simple css syntax to describe the elements it will try to retrieve. i.e., if i want to retrieve all elements with class ""my-class"", which has a div ancestor: $('div .my-class').
- Easy Ajax Jquery has implemented a very convenient and easy cross-browser ajax. Handling callbacks, passing values as json or other data format is straight forward. Moreover, there are simplified versions of the $.ajax() method for just $.get() for loading a url, $.getJSON() for loading json data and $.post() method for posting data to the server (using POST method).
- Plugin System One is able to extend jquery by plugins. Jquery plugins are usually additional javascript code which is overloaded to the Jquery object, allowing to achieve components, effects and easy tasks like $(element).grid(), $(element).treeview(), $(element).editable() etc. the Jquery website hosts thousands of useful plugins for free use, all categorized by its relevance - you don't need to reinvent the wheel - some of it is already there (if not all) and you can use it, extend it and learn from it.
- Worldwide community support Jquery is being used by many (millions...). Microsoft officially supports this library integrating tools in its developer web tools, the web is full with tutorials, mentors and help using jquery for any project or use.
- Excellent Event Management System jquery has a very convenient event management. you can bind events easily and you get an event object (again, cross-browser) with useful properties. One addition that I like is the ability to have a namespace for any event, i.e.: $('#myId').bind('click.anyObject'). Now, when myId is clicked, it will trigger a click with the additional property of ""anyObject"" as a namespace. In fact, you can use this namspace again for more objects.
- Dom Manipulation is a breeze Jquery has simple syntax for removing, adding, appending or operating any kind of manipulation on dom elements including attribute manipulation. i.e., for removing an element: $('#myElement').remove(), for deep cloning an element: $('#myElement').clone().
- Getting form element values Again. the elegant way of getting values from any form element is simply as: $('#someFormElement').val(). However, you can also use the form function $('myForm').serialize() to retrieve a query string which includes the form elements with their values ready to be sent with an ajax call.
- Get the source dom element Sometimes, you'll want to use the source dom element resulted in your jquery object,so you can finally revert back and get the reference source dom object easily with: $('.myClass').get(5); (where you can use any index to get any object in the jquery result set).
- BONUS Reason: Method Chaining I couldn't avoid this one: since jquery mostly returns a jquery object, you can write few operations in one line. i.e.: $('.tool-tips').append(' ').addClass('new-tool-tip').bind('click', someFunctionName);
These are some of my 10 good reasons for using jquery. I'm sure there are a lot of other good reasons for using jquery in your projects. It's fast, it's dynamic, it's open source, it's cross-browser and it's beautiful and elegant. I'm sure once you start developing with it, you'll feel very comfortable and you'll get the feeling of where it can assist you and save time while writing elegant code.",What is the bonus reason for using jQuery as your JavaScript framework?,This question cannot be answered.,False,0,"10 good reasons for using jquery as your javascript framework

87,352,"With each passing day, although neither team has played a game and – because it’s an evaluation period and neither staff can speak to a recruit – Rutgers puts more distance between itself and in-state rival Seton Hall.
By the end of the week, Fred Hill, Jr., will formally become the next coach of the Scarlet Knights, replacing Gary Waters, who resigned.
The Post learned that St. Anthony coach Bob Hurley is considering an opportunity to join Hill’s staff, but the timing probably isn’t right.
“Who wouldn’t want a legendary coach like Bob Hurley on his bench?” Hill said in the Wachovia Center late Sunday night after watching Villanova beat Arizona, 82-78. “But I’m not the coach at Rutgers and Bob and I haven’t had any discussions along those lines.”
Hurley has 873 wins at St. Anthony and would like to post 900 as a high school coach. He is the most respected prep coach in the Garden State and, should he ever decide to become a college assistant, would be a major coup for any Big East program.
“At this point I’m looking forward to two more years at St. Anthony,” Hurley said. “I feel I need a number to get me to shut it down and the 900 is out there. Then I think I’d like to try something else in coaching.”
Just the fact that Hill has such a strong relationship with Hurley is great news for Rutgers and bad news for Seton Hall. Seton Hall coach Louis Orr has two years left on his contract, but his status is in limbo.
Orr wants an extension, but sources said the administration at the South Orange school is not convinced Orr has established solid enough state recruiting ties. The Pirates will lose their two best players next season – guard Donald Copeland and center Kelly Whitney – and they have no recruits signed.
According to the sources, Orr is mulling three possible scenarios: He accepts a guaranteed one-year extension; he opts to leave because an extension isn’t offered; he refuses to make changes to his staff, forcing a parting of the ways.
Seton Hall athletic director Joe Quinlan did not return phone calls, but Quinlan – who will meet with Orr this week – has a list of candidates in case he needs to make a change.
Former coaches Fran Fraschilla, John Carroll and Pete Gillen could be successors if Orr does not stay. Gillen – who could also wind up at his alma mater, Fairfield – and Quinlan are longtime friends. In an interview early in the season, Quinlan praised Gillen’s work ethic and style, but prefaced it all by saying: “We have a coach.”
Carroll, one of P.J. Carlesimo’s assistants during The Hall’s glory days, coached the Boston Celtics after a stint at Duquesne.
Hofstra coach Tom Pecora, who is said to be happy in Hempstead, and George Mason coach Jim Larranaga of The Bronx are also possibilities. Both are in the midst of postseason runs – Pecora in the NIT, Larranaga in the Sweet 16.

93,24,"Wednesday’s word of the day, quantum (from Wordsmith.org) illustrates, in one word, my perception of time lately: there isn’t much of it.
Instead of crafting a quick story for a Wednesday’s Word post, I searched for a quote that might give color to the word. I found one that indirectly speaks to my desire to write and the courage it takes to keep me writing, even when the inspiration flickers out.
Today’s word:
quantum. noun.
1. A quantity or amount.
2. A portion.
3. A large amount.
4. The smallest amount of something that can exist independently.
, American business owner, career counselor, author.
A new year approaches. And,2010 calls for fresh goals but demands repeat determination.
Don’t just imagine, Someday I’d like to be a writer.
Write.
Because “anything worth doing is worth doing…” now.
Interesting that you consider it courageous to keep writing even when you’re not inspired. I’ve never thought of writing as courageous … well, not fiction writing. I want to know more of your viewpoint.
I read that quote and immediately thought about the risk in writing.
For years I wanted to call myself a writer; I wanted to take the plunge. But I never ventured outside of my journal or a few personal letters that recounted a silly experience.
Starting a blog was taking a risk. Submitting my first piece (in it’s own infancy) was taking a risk.
It would be easy to imagine the smile on my face when that first novel is finished and published, instead of actually rewriting that novel to submittable quality. And, then sending it out into the query world.
And, I thought of your recent post (), and how even when I feel uninspired or unrecognized (with just one more rejection email to archive), I still write.
I’m in a weird mood, I guess, or maybe I’m completely missing your point, but I’m not being flippant.
Is what you feel you’re risking only the rejection of your work? I know it’s hard not to feel like a conjoined twin with your writing, but I’ve finally accepted that agents and editors are just businessmen and my work is only a product to them.
I realize, of course, for a writer who has to make a living from her writing, selling the product is extremely important. I don’t have to sell my work, so I’ve come to the point where I view the act of writing, the creation of story, as the valuable part … not the selling. So, in that sense, writing is not a risk to me.
I would like to share it, and so I will try to sell it, but if I never succeed, it does not diminish the accomplishment of writing a novel (or story), nor does that make me enjoy my work less.
I don’t think you’re being flippant. Maybe I’m not expressing myself well.
For me, the risk in writing comes in the act itself: to write is to make myself vulnerable, whether I write memoir or fiction, since each story I write reveals a small part of myself or my psyche.
The risk also comes in sharing that story (and that small piece of myself) with others, whether they pay to read it or not.
I hope that reads more clear than my first comment.
Ha ha, you were clear. I was trying to let you know I didn’t want you to think I was being flippant in the comment I was about to make.
I guess a year ago I felt like you. I’ve had enough experience in critique groups now that I don’t think of it as a risk to share my work. But I think I feel more separated from my work than you do.
Christi, I also feel the act of writing takes courage. For me, writing (including fiction writing) is often a painful, fearful experience. What I fear isn’t so much that others will reject me but that I will reject the parts of myself exposed in the writing process.
To be honest, I never thought, Someday I’d like to be a writer. Instead, I thought, Someday I’d like to stop lying to myself. A tiny part of my psyche decided years ago that I’m writer, so now I try to earn the right to say so aloud.
“2010 calls for fresh goals but demands repeat determination.” Yes, and I like the clarity in this statement.
Ann, I love this: A tiny part of my psyche decided years ago that I’m writer, so now I try to earn the right to say so aloud.

97,576,"Jeff Larson defends use of RNC funds [INTERVIEW]
By Andy Mannix and Mike Mullen
In 2008, St. Paul hosted the Republican National Convention. Republican strategist Jeff Larson was the CEO and treasurer of the host committee, which raised $65 million prior to the four-day event (Read this week's feature, RNC Piggy Bank). After the convention left town and its debts were paid, the host committee still had a surplus of more than $7 million.
Though the bulk would go to charity, a number of individuals and companies continued to receive payments from the surplus years after the convention. Several campaign finance experts who analyzed the expenditure reports for City Pages say the pattern of spending so long after the convention is abnormal, and deserves an explanation.
For this we went to Larson, the man in charge. Larson declined to be interviewed over the phone, but agreed to answer questions via e-mail. Larson did not respond to questions about payments made to specific individuals after the convention. Here's an abbreviated version of what he would tell us:
City Pages: Can you start by explaining who selected you to be CEO of the 2008 Republican National Convention Host Committee? Why were you interested in taking this job?
Jeff Larson: I believed the Twin Cities needed a shot in the arm. It had been a long time since the Minneapolis St Paul had hosted anything nearly as large as the National Convention. You would have to go back to the Super Bowl in 1991 since we were on the national stage...
...Since it was the Republican Convention that decided to come here, and since the Host Committee needed someone who knew the community and knew the workings of the RNC, they asked me to take this position. I did it to help ensure Minneapolis Saint Paul put on a world-class Convention that put us on the map with other convention cities like Chicago, Boston, New York, New Orleans, Denver and Los Angeles. We did exactly that thanks to our Board, our team, and the community.
CP: It's been more than two years now since the convention, and the host committee still exists. Why has the committee not closed yet?
JL: The short answer is the Federal Elections Commission had not allowed us to do so
CP: You told National Journal reporter Ed Pound in 2008 that your position as CEO of the committee was unpaid. Why?
JL: I was brought on as the Chief Executive Officer of the Host Committee on July 1, 2007. According to the written Consulting Agreement, I could be reimbursed for expenses but draw no consulting fee or payment. I was eligible for a discretionary bonus at the conclusion of the convention based on the Board's view of how well I achieved certain goals and if there was any money left over.
On July 21, 2009, the Board of Directors held an Executive Session to discuss my performance as Chief Executive Officer of the Host Committee. At that time, I had served as the CEO for over 2 years. The Board voted to pay me $400,000 for this work.

LANA R. THOMAS, Plaintiff,v.ROCKBRIDGE REGIONAL JAIL, Defendant.
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
NORMAN K. MOON, District Judge.
The pro se Plaintiff has filed an application to proceed without prepaying fees or costs, along with various other documents, described herein, which I will construe as a complaint. I hereby grant Plaintiff's motion and dismiss the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915 for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
I.
A summary of the contents of Plaintiff's documents follows:
A letter, dated June 26, 2014, from the Office of the Clerk of the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia in Roanoke informing Plaintiff that documents she had submitted ""do not meet our requirements for filing a new civil case."" The letter further informs Plaintiff that, among other things, she ""will need to submit a complaint."" The letter states that the respondent had ""enclosed a pro se handbook [that would] instruct [Plaintiff] on what [she would] need to submit to have a new civil case filed in our court.""
A copy of a Rockbridge Regional Jail inmate grievance form, dated July 25, 2012, wherein Plaintiff stated that she had been handled roughly when she ""was brought into the Jail 7-21-2012."" She complained that her left arm was hurt and that the officer who mistreated her falsely stated that she had ""refused medical."" She claimed that her ribs felt like they were ""cracked or bruised badly, "" that she had spoken to two nurses but no doctors, and that she ""still [had] headaches due to [her] head being ramed [ sic ] in the wall."" She added that she was ""still in lots of pain with head ribs leg left wrist have lots of brusing [ sic ], "" but that she ""was not drunk or I'd fault [ sic ] back."" The grievance form includes a response from a lieutenant at the jail, stating that Plaintiff was ""on the list to see the doctor tomorrow."" Plaintiff signed an acknowledgment of the response, stating that she did ""not wish to appeal this decision.""
A copy of a Rockbridge Regional Jail inmate grievance form, dated August 1, 2012, wherein Plaintiff complained that she ""filed to see a Dr., "" that ""Nurse Penny came in the cell and told the girls some one had told on someone."" Plaintiff added that she ""saw a Dr., "" ""but the Dr's orders were not carried out."" The grievance form includes a response from a lieutenant at the jail, stating that Plaintiff had ""an appt. set up for x-ray."" Plaintiff signed an acknowledgment of the response, stating that she was not ""satisfied with the above answer or response"" and marking the form to indicate that she ""wish[ed] to appeal this decision.""
An inventory form listing the property that was seized when Plaintiff was booked on July 21, 2012. It states that Plaintiff did not sign the receipt because she was ""too inebriated.""
Two of four pages of discharge instructions from Baptist Regional Medical Center in Corbin, Kentucky, dated September 5, 2012. The instructions state that Plaintiff had been treated for ""[a]cute exacerbation of COPD"" and ""[m]ultiple contusions of right lower leg and left wrist.""
Seven of nine pages of discharge instructions from Wake Emergency Physicians in Cary, North Carolina. It states that Plaintiff was diagnosed with a wrist sprain and a contusion.
II.
Under 28 U.S.C. § 1915, district courts have a duty to screen initial filings and dismiss a complaint filed in forma pauperis ""at any time if the court determines that... the action or appeal...). ""[Section] 1915 permits district courts to independently assess the merits of in forma pauperis complaints, and to exclude suits that have no arguable basis in law or fact.'"" Eriline, 440 F.3d at 656 (quoting Nasim v. Warden, Md. House of Correction, 64 F.3d 951, 954 (4th Cir. 1995)).
As it stands, Plaintiffs documents do not include a complaint, [1] and she fails to state a legal claim upon which relief may be granted. Scheid v. Fanny Farmer Candy Shops, Inc., 859 F.2d 434, 437 (6th Cir. 1988).

She claimed that her ribs felt like they were ""cracked or bruised badly, "" that she had spoken to two nurses but no doctors, and that she ""still [had] headaches due to [her] head being ramed [ sic ] in the wall."" She added that she was ""still in lots of pain with head ribs leg left wrist have lots of brusing [ sic ], "" but that she ""was not drunk or I'd fault [ sic ] back.""

Eriline, 440 F.3d at 656 (quoting Nasim v. Warden, Md. House of Correction, 64 F.3d 951, 954 (4th Cir. 1995)).
As it stands, Plaintiffs documents do not include a complaint, [1] and she fails to state a legal claim upon which relief may be granted. Scheid v. Fanny Farmer Candy Shops, Inc., 859 F.2d 434, 437 (6th Cir. 1988). And, although district courts have a duty to construe pro se pleadings liberally, a pro se plaintiff must nevertheless allege facts that state a cause of action, and district courts are not required ""to conjure up questions never squarely presented to them.""[2] Beaudett, 775 F.2d at 1278 (adding that ""[d]istrict judges are not mind readers"").

107,531,"Organizations take precautions in the midst of coronavirus pandemic
FAIRFIELD COUNTY - A fluid situation. A common phrase surrounding local organizations' approach to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The effects of the coronavirus are already being seen in Ohio from the Ohio High School Athletic Association's decision on Thursday to postpone the remainder of the winter tournaments to restrictions to visitors to nursing homes.
During a press conference Thursday afternoon, Gov. Mike DeWine made several major announcements including an order restricting mass gatherings of groups larger than 100, excluding restaurants, libraries, hospitals and grocery stores.
In addition, he announced an ""extended spring break"" of three weeks for Ohio's children beginning Monday.
Even before the announcement schools had been working on their plans for what do to if schools had to close.
Lancaster City School District Superintendent Steve Wigton said all the actions the school has taken is precautionary and they will be following the state's recommendations.
In a letter sent to district parents, Wigton assured them the administration was observing the news and adjusting as necessary. In an effort to keep students up on the curriculum, plans involving take-home lessons were outlined.
""The elementary school students would have their packets to fill out, and junior and high school students will be able to use their Chromebooks to complete their online assignments,"" Wigton said. ""For students that don't have internet available at home, there are still hotspots available through our T-Mobile grant.""
He said all events for all grades, kindergarten through 12, involving parents and the public have been cancelled until after the district's spring break. For any other additional changes, Wigton said they'd be announced by building administrators.
""We don't want to confuse an already confusing situation. We're going to try to postpone what events we can and see what we need to implement to create social distance,"" he said. ""We've also reminded students of proper handwashing procedures, and the schools have plenty of disinfectant and soap.""
""These are extraordinary times, and extraordinary measures. But we have extraordinary people and we will get through this.""
The Fairfield County Jail has also started implementing safe practices to help limit contact with people showing syndromes of the novel coronavirus.
""We've started to have our medical experts screening incoming inmates in the sally port. So far none of have shown any symptoms of the virus, but we are prepared to reject them,"" Alex Lape, Fairfield County Sheriff's Office chief deputy, said. ""They'll most likely be sent to Fairfield Medical Center for examination.""

- NCAA men's and women's basketball tournaments will not include fans due to coronavirus concerns
- Fairfield County polling places won't be moved due to coronavirus
- 3 cases of coronavirus confirmed in Cuyahoga County; DeWine declares state of emergency
- Ohio asks universities to go to remote learning; wants limits on sports due to coronavirus
For now, the sheriff's office is working to limit contact within the jail and the civil branch. Lape said none of the inmates or staff have displayed any symptoms, but it's best to be cautious for now. Visits were non-contact to begin with, and can be conducted online.
Lape added the sheriff's office is working closely with the health department and the Fairfield County Emergency Management Agency to keep ahead of the situation.
""We have plans in place in case we have to enact them. Right now, we're focused on maintaining the health of those incarcerated and our staff,"" he said.
Father Craig Eilerman, of St. Mary's of the Assumption in Lancaster, said events involving people outside the parish have been cancelled.
""We will continue to have masses, unless we are told otherwise or if the pandemic spreads here. However, we are cancelling some of our other events, just to help minimize the risk of spreading any illness,"" he said. ""And during our masses, we will only be distributing the consecrated bread, there will be no wine.""
""These actions are preventative in nature, the idea is to cut down on large gatherings as much as we can. We are a people of hope, we will get through this.""
Rev. Brian Jones, the senior pastor of the Lancaster First United Methodist Church, issued the following statement.
""We are taking the outbreak of the Coronavirus seriously. We are taking extra measures to disinfect the ""touchpoints' of the church (door handles pews door knobs etc.) throughout the week to insure we keep the church as clean and virus free as possible. Your health, and the health of your family are a priority for us in our overall ministry. We are not planning to cancel worship. As far as other events we will treat them on a week to week basis as we hope the crisis will pass in due time and our ministry schedules can return to normal.""
The Pickerington Food Bank announced it would also be changing its delivery options for the time being.
In a statement, the food pantry said it will be distributing pre-packaged boxes on Thursdays and Saturdays only from 10 to 11:30 a.m., beginning March 19. It will no longer be open on Mondays.
When customers arrive at the pantry, they should proceed down the alley, as they did for holiday basket distributions. Registration will be conducted in the parking lot and the boxes will be delivered to the vehicle. Customers will not have to leave their cars. These precautions follow the Center for Disease Control's guidelines for ""social distancing.""

I was driving Dylan to scouts today when this conversation ensued:
Dylan: Mom, next time you put that sticky popcorn stuff in my lunch, you need to also pack a plate, a fork, and a knife.
Me: You mean the carmel corn?
Dylan: Yeah. It is just wayyy too sticky to eat with my fingers.
Me: But it's popcorn. You want to use a knife and fork to eat popcorn??
Dylan: Yeah. It was just...really difficult to eat with my fingers.
Me: First of all, no. I'm never packing you a plate, fork, and knife to eat carmel corn. Secondly, it might be nice every once in awhile to hear, ""Thank you for putting an extra treat in my lunch, Mom."" Or, ""Thanks for packing my lunch every day, Mom."" All I get are complaints!
Dylan: Oh, Mom, you do so many things really good, too.
Me: Well, I never hear the good things. Only the bad.
Dylan: Do you want me to tell you the good things you do?
Me: Yes. Yes, I do.
Dylan: Well, you are a really good cleaner. You are seriously so good at mopping. And you're a really good cook, too. Is that better?
Me: Yes. Yes, it is.
After I dropped him off, I felt that this conversation seemed vaguely familiar.
And then I realized why. I have this same type of conversation with my husband all the time. :) He tries to make a helpful suggestion, I get all butt-hurt, and then I passive-aggressively make him tell me the good things I do. It's our schtick.

116,177,"Charles “Chuck” Edelstein, a retired senior judge in the 11th Judicial Circuit and national consultant on court management, began his career in 1965 as an assistant state attorney in the powder keg office of the late State Attorney Richard Gerstein. Gerstein was the Dade County prosecutor who uncovered the first direct links between the Watergate burglary and the White House of President Richard M. Nixon, who wintered in Key Biscayne.
The office, which featured future Circuit Court Judge and former Miami Beach Mayor Seymour Gelber, Janet Reno, and the late Miami trial lawyer Edward Carhart, turned out a legal team who mentored one another and became lifelong friends.
Edelstein died Tuesday at his Coral Gables home after a six-month battle with cancer. He was 78.
“Chuck was an inspiration to all of us,” said Tom Petersen, who spent 25 years as a circuit judge in Miami-Dade. “We were all better people for having known him.”
Never miss a local story.
The two met in 1966 when Petersen moved to Miami after law school. “He was responsible for me getting my first job with the State Attorney’s office in the diversion program for first offenders,” Petersen said. “Sy [Gelber] was his mentor and my mentor and we’ve all remained friends.”
Chuck was a man for all seasons. A talented guy who had a tremendous range of interests. A judge. An author. A consultant. A professor. A photographer.
Judge Tom Petersen.
Defense lawyer James McGuirk, a former assistant state attorney, also came of age with Edelstein in Gerstein’s office. They met as 17-year-old freshman at the University of Florida.
“We were young idealists. He grew older but he never changed. He became a father, a prosecutor, an appellate lawyer, a judge and a court management specialist — and always an idealist,” McGuirk said. “The best thing I can say about him is Seymour Gelber thought the world of him.”
Gelber, now 97, agreed. “Oh boy, was he idealistic,” he said. “A great lawyer. Loved the law.” Edelstein didn’t brandish his stature, Gelber said, “but he let himself be heard. He spoke out and was a powerful speaker. He wasn’t going to win over the world but he was my man.”
Gov. Bob Graham appointed Edelstein to the bench in 1979. He later coordinated the design and construction and renovation of courtrooms and buildings in Miami-Dade as an assistant court administrator and director of court facilities for the 11th Judicial Circuit.
Edelstein, an outdoors man and marathon runner, turned into an award-winning photographer in 2015 when Defenders of Wildlife awarded his photograph of a wild wolf family in Alaska’s Denali National Park its grand prize. He was also a law professor and director of the trial advocacy program at the University of Miami.
The Neptune, New Jersey-born Edelstein spearheaded reforms in caseload management practices in Miami-Dade, Seminole and Brevard counties. The Criminal Law Section of the Florida Bar honored him in 2015 for his role in reducing jail population.
In one of his letters to the Miami Herald’s editorial pages, Edelstein, then a senior judge in 2008, wrote: “Effective, relevant education and decent-paying jobs give kids a stake in the community and a future with hope and dignity. With a paycheck and self-esteem, crime rates will fall.”
Edelstein’s survivors include his wife Diane, his children Shari and Amy, four grandchildren, and his brother Joel. A memorial will be at 5 p.m. July 20 at Newman Alumni Center at the University of Miami, 6200 San Amaro Dr., Coral Gables.

117,539,"GRAND FORKS, N.D. – After 17-consecutive games without a win, the University of North Dakota women’s soccer team picked up a huge win over in-state rival North Dakota State, 4-2, Wednesday at Bronson Field.
The last win for UND came on Sept. 7, 2012 against South Dakota State, 3-1. North Dakota had also been shutout in five of the first-six games to start this season.
However, all that came to an end as UND received scoring from four separate players to power past the Bison. Additionally, three players scored their first collegiate goals.
Caitlin Dahl scored in the 11th minute to give North Dakota the early lead. Fellow freshman Zoe Foster dished a pass to Dahl from the right flank toward the top of the 18-yard box. Dahl took a high shot that curled in off the crossbar and off the goalkeeper’s fingers.
Dahl’s goal would stand as the lone mark of the first half, as the second half would feature a flurry of scoring.
Within five minutes after the start of the second half, North Dakota extended its lead when freshman Robyn Wujkowski got her head on a loose ball inside the 6-yard box. NDSU’s goalkeeper Katie McCormick tried corralling the ball after it was played in, but a scramble that ensued between her and her defensemen allowed Wujkowski to get enough on the ball to put in in the back of the net for her first collegiate goal.
Unfortunately, UND was unable to keep a clean sheet as NDSU’s Katie Tallas scored off a header in the 62nd minute to cut the lead in half.
Just eight minutes later, however, Foster stole the ball in the attacking third and had room to carry it into the right side of the box. After a few touches, the freshman put the ball in the upper far corner for her second goal of the season, giving UND back its two-goal lead.
Three minutes later, Wujkowski and sophomore Marissa Ricci created a two-on-one break after the Bison turned the ball over while pressing through midfield. Wujkowski passed the ball just outside of the box and Ricci finished the pay, chipping the ball over the goalkeeper for her first collegiate goal.
With time running out and North Dakota up 4-1, the Bison continued to attack, eventually finding a second goal with only 19 seconds remaining in the game. Meghan Johnston put back in a rebound after an initial shot was deflected within the 6-yard box, making the final score 4-2.
Kirsten Olsen also had a penalty-kick opportunity after NDSU was called for a handball inside the box. Olsen got the shot on net, but NDSU’s McCormick made the save.
UND goalkeeper Kristi Hestdalen recorded five saves in the contest. North Dakota out-shot the Bison 21-19, with a shots-on-goal margin of 10-8 in UND’s favor.

Let the hacking commence.
Last month’s crippling cyber-attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment revealed confidential information of business practices, employee pay disparities and personal data, unpublished scripts, sensitive contracts, and ugly personal feuds between actors and executives. Experts say these secrets could damage the Hollywood studio for years to come.
Although an unknown hacking group calling themselves the “Guardians of Peace” has taken partial credit for the major cyber-leak, the FBI is yet to determine the culprit,
Rather than focusing on traditional targets of cyber-intrusions, such as credit cards, those behind the attack chose to use sensitive information as a weapon of vengeance for Sony’s supposed misdeeds.
The consequences for Sony have been swift and devastating since the public attack, exposing the media company to potential lawsuits and Hollywood backlash.
Perhaps the most damaging will harm Sony’s reputation, and the harsh reality that even the biggest corporate lines and computer systems are vulnerable to attack.
“There is a ring of fire around the trade secrets of Hollywood, and the value of executives is in their ability to keep confidences and secrets and to maintain a level of distance,” said Jeremy Goldman, an entertainment and intellectual property attorney for Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz.
A humiliating email chain between Sony co-chairwoman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin was among those leaked, with Mr. Rudin fighting over copyright issues for the forthcoming Steve Jobs biopic, “Jobs” (which was eventually lost to Universal), and pressuring Ms. Pascal to shelve the Sony remake of “Cleopatra” starring Angelina Jolie. Rudin called Jolie, who requested director David Fincher to direct the “Cleopatra” remake, a “minimally talented spoiled brat” while Pascal unsuccessfully tried to calm him down.
Even more incriminating leaks include an exchange of emails between Sony executives which criticize President Barack Obama, insinuating racist comments as Rudin and Pascal start guessing what movies and actors the President might like, each tied to African Americans.
“Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO [Unchained]?” Pascal asks in an email reported from BuzzFeed, to which Rudin responds, “12 YEARS [A SLAVE].”
More emails were released which reveal unflattering comments about big names in Hollywood such as Tom Cruise, David Fincher, Aaron Sorkin, Kevin Hart, and Adam Sandler.
Pascal’s harsh words in the emails reveals a dark side of one of corporate America’s most powerful leading female executives, who became co-chair of Sony Pictures in 2003 and helped develop box-office hits like “The Amazing Spider-Ma”n and several “James Bond” films. apologize for any injury they might have caused.”
Because of the leaks, Sony executives are no longer corresponding via email but through text messages in a temporary effort to avoid further information exposure. Experts suggest that the studio may now have to pay its top-tier talent, particularly A-list celebrities like Jolie, three times as much as part of the damage control.
Possible link to North Korea?
FBI officials and investigators are also determining whether the cyber-attack is linked to North Korea, a reclusive nation with an increasingly potent hacking capability. Sources say the hack may have occurred in retaliation for Sony’s upcoming Christmas release, The Interview, a comedy built around a fictional CIA plot to kill North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, who is revered in the nation. North Koreans have repeatedly denounced the film, warning of “stern” and “merciless” retaliation, but the government has declined to comment.
The hacking into one of Hollywood’s biggest studios has alarmed US officials and cyber security experts, who say this is the first major attack on a US company to use malicious software designed to “incapacitate” computer networks.
“This is a step beyond what they’ve done in the past, but it’s a logical trajectory for them,” said James Lewis, a cyber expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
A State Department official declined to comment on the allegations, but said, “We are aware of reports about North Korean concerns about this movie. While it may be difficult for them to understand the concept, in the United States entertainers are free to make movies of their choosing.”
“There is no attribution to North Korea at this point,” said Joe Demarest, assistant director with the FBI’s cyber division.
Sony has also declined to comment on the growing suspicions or internal damage to the company.
Though there is no definite knowledge that North Korea is responsible for the hack, the country is remembered for its previous retaliation cyber-attacks against South Korean companies.
The FBI plans to meet with Sony executives to better train them in cyber security awareness, and is continuing its investigation of the alleged attackers.

The curriculum covers board leadership and governance topics which include strategic planning, financial leadership, legal roles and responsibilities, fundraising, and more.
Leadership - Board participation is an excellent way to exercise leadership competence. Through our culturally-informed leadership ""lunch & learns"" with a certified executive leadership coach, participants develop a deeper understanding of their personal leadership style and how to prepare for more complex roles in any organization.
Inclusion & Diversity - Participants are empowered to be change agents on boards by helping organizations to be more culturally-align with the communities they serve. Inclusive and diverse teams make better decisions and can help to expand the networks of funders, volunteers, and other key stakeholders. Participants will learn steps to institutionalizing inclusivity and diversity.

128,188,"Ah, another of my mo irregularly scheduled posts - my 'weekly' favourites! I have been going crazy for pink nude shades lately, on my face as well as my lips, so this week's favourites reflect that.
Fist up is Essie nail polish in muchi muchi, a cute pale pink shade that I've loved wearing to work lately. I don't own too many Essie polishes due to my undying love for Barry M, but I love this colour and the bottle is already almost half empty.
Next is a lipgloss in the form of Tanya Burr's Aurora, which is a gorgeous dusky pink that adds a nice natural rosy shine to my lips. The applicator on these lip glosses is the perfect shape to coat your lips in, I own two other shades in the range and they are definitely my new favourites!
Another lip product that's made it's way into my favourites is my new Maybelline ColorSensation lipstick in Tantalising Taupe, from the Stripped Nudes collection. The formula of these lipsticks are, in my opinion, superior to most other drugstore lipsticks - they are easily on the same level quality wise as some high end counterparts and for only a fraction of the price! The colour payoff (ugh dat phrase!) is excellent, I can see myself investing in this entire collection eventually! This shade looks particularly good with a smokey eye, and has a dewy sheen finish.
Lastly there is an old favourite that I have rediscovered, the beautiful Autograph Highlighting powder. This is just so pretty to look at, and I have been sweeping it over my cheeks and lightly down my nose - where ever would usually catch the light - and the result is fantastic. This is a product that would probably go unnoticed my many because it is a lesser talked about brand in terms of make up, but I cannot recommend it enough, it's lovely!
Have you tried any of these products? What have you been loving this week? xx

The author thinks that the formula of Maybelline ColorSensation lipstick in Tantalising Taupe is superior to most other drugstore lipsticks and is easily on the same level quality wise as some high end counterparts. The author also appreciates the excellent colour payoff and the dewy sheen finish of this lipstick.",628

A 10-year-old boy from Fulwood who taught himself how to solve a Rubik’s cube has raised almost £500 for Rock FM’s Cash for Kids by completing a timed challenge.
Oliver Coupland watched YouTube videos to learn how to complete the puzzle using algorithms. He then set himself the challenge of solving a Rubik’s cube in between two and six minutes in line with the 2.6 Challenge.
In an uncanny twist, Oliver completed the challenge in two minutes 26 seconds.
Oliver said: “I started learning the cube a few months ago and during lockdown I had lots of time to practise and watch the online videos about how to solve it. I really struggled to understand the first video on how to solve the third layer. I then found another video and put them both together to teach myself. It’s all about learning different algorithms and looking for the available pieces to work with that algorithm.
“On the day I solved it for the first time, my Mum had read about the 2.6 Challenge and suggested I could do something with my Rubik’s cube. Cash For Kids help children who haven’t always got the best living conditions and are sometimes short of food and basic supplies, so Mum and I thought this would be a great charity to raise money for. They also support the school where my Mum works.”
Oliver set himself a fundraising target of £100 but has so far raised over £450.
“I felt a bit nervous about doing the challenge in case I didn’t manage to do it. I was also really excited because if I did manage to do it then I knew I would raise a lot of money.
“I feel really happy about all the support I’ve had and so many people are really proud of me. I feel so excited when my iPad pings to tell me I’ve received another donation!”

We have more anomalies than I almost know what to do with. There are a handful of good ones too, but what can I do with them? I've finished my review of Oblivion, unless I want to mention the bombastic score too, but I think I've done enough. I suppose it depends on what these other two signatures are that have popped up overnight. I launch probes and scan, resolving gas and more gas to go with the rest of the gas accumulating in our system. I should probably generate some ISK for our operations.
To the tower, in to the Golem marauder, and out to the first anomaly of the evening. Rewatching Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol the other day, I couldn't help but wonder why it was revealed that Hendriks went to the meeting in the Burj Khalifa with a mask on. It was established that Wistrom, his right-hand man and choice for the disguise, hadn't met their contact, Moreau, otherwise the duped meeting with the M:I squad wouldn't have worked. Surely Hendriks knew that, so why disguise himself as Wistrom?
I can understand Hendriks perhaps not wanting to wander around without a disguise, because of his high profile status. I can almost understand him not wanting to send Wistrom to the meeting unsupervised, because of the high stakes in what was involved, although you'd think he'd trust his right-hand man more. But if you are Hendriks wanting to make sure you got the right materials, weren't double-crossed, and weren't recognised, why disguise yourself as your known accomplice? Wistrom essentially attracted just as much attention as Hendriks.
It would have made more sense for Hendriks to turn up wearing a completely neutral disguise, because he wouldn't have been tracked and Moreau wouldn't have noticed. Or wear a neutral disguise and pretend to be Wistrom's right-hand man for the deal, to be there, be represented, and still go unnoticed. It seems that the reveal of the mask was there solely to have one used in a manner that didn't spoil the plot by being entirely overused, as in M:I 2, and tucked away at the end of an action sequence in the hopes of its not making any sense going unnoticed. Maybe I'm missing something.
Two anomalies are cleared of Sleepers, and their wrecks are looted and salvaged to bring back a fair 170 Miskies of plunder. That's not bad. The first anomaly even had my Golem not sitting in a blinding fog bank, letting me enjoy the view. It was almost a pleasant experience. Now to poke our neighbouring class 3 w-space system in my Proteus strategic cruiser, see what's happening in today's local constellation.
Jumping to C3a has my directional scanner showing me nothing, although opening the system map and seeing just how much space there is between the planets makes the negative result less surprising. One planet is in range, and the system is 125 AU across. There doesn't look to be much too see overall, which there isn't, but the eight anomalies and six signatures are spread over so much volume that it feels like less. I launch probes and perform a blanket scan to see if I can add any ships to the signatures, and I can't. There aren't even any structures, none at all, so the system is unoccupied.
I scan. Gas, wormhole, wormhole, relics, and a wormhole. There's a lot of space between our K162 and the wormholes, and as there's no occupation to watch I am in warp to each connection as soon as it is resolved. A K162 from class 4 w-space could be interesting, the static exit to low-sec obviously leads to Domain, and a K162 from class 2 w-space would be much more attractive if it weren't at the end of its life. Never mind, I pop out to Domain to bookmark the K162 in low-sec, duly noting the three extra signatures should I need more to scan, then back to C3a and across to see what's waiting for me in C4a.
My goodness, it's the nexus of w-space: J100001. Naturally, there is a tower lacking ships visible on d-scan, and although a big cluster of green highlights fourteen anomalies there are only two signatures present. Maybe the other one is a K162. I warp away from the wormhole and tower, launch probes, and blanket the system. Nope, the other signature is weak, clearly not a K162. Curious, and because it's just one, I identify the signature as gas. There's nothing else to do in this system, and I head back to low-sec to see what the signatures are there. Back through a now-dying C247 to C3a, a clear indication that I'm hours late to whatever activity there might have been.
Three extra signatures in low-sec, three wormholes resolved. I warp to the first, wondering how many will be a result of the explosion of empire-empire connections tonight, and drop out of warp next to, huh, another K162 from deadly class 6 w-space. These seem more frequent too. The second wormhole is an N944 to more low-sec, leading to Essence from the colours, and relatively useless. The last is a K162 from class 5 w-space. Not great options, but I work with what I've got.
In to C5a and d-scan is clear, a blanket scan revealing seventeen anomalies and ten signatures. Again there are no ships and no structures. I've done enough here. Back to low-sec, across to the other K162, and in to C6a. D-scan is clear, and I have to page my way through fifty-six anomalies to see the fourteen signatures, lack of ships, and sole structure somewhere in the system. That ain't no on-line tower. I'm not finding anything tonight, it seems. Not with this attitude, at least, the attitude of going home to get some sleep.

Yesterday I was asked by a friend as we talked about the economy and politics: ""What's wrong with this country?""

Unfortunately I believe we have become a nation and a Christian people who more closely resemble the gentiles described in this passage. The admonition from Paul is that we ""no longer live as the Gentiles"". His accusation against them was that they were living from the ""emptiness of their souls and the futility of their minds."" I think that is a pretty good description of the church today. Paul further goes on to state that they are ""estranged, self-banished from the life of God with no share in it because of their ignorance.
Paul is making the case that there were folks in the church who were living far below the potential that God intended for them. When I read about those times when God is actively moving in the hearts of a nation or group of people, there is great hope: not futility.
Paul further says that this spiritual dilemma is because of the hardness of their own hearts. It's not because of a some outside variable that we are the victims of. It is because of the hardness of our own hearts that we live beneath God's intended level of spiritual life.
Sometimes when I gain weight, I reach a point where I ""just don't care"" and say I'd rather be fat and happy! That's the physical equivalent of hardening my heart to the idea that there is a better way to live. But that better way takes discipline. I have to say yes to broccoli and no to Krispy Kreme and that's hard sometimes! In a physical sense, to experience God's best requires personal discipline on my part. Far more importantly, if I want to live at the level that God has for me spiritually, it takes discipline.
Paul said ""Hard Hearts"" was the cause. I'm not sure how to soften a hard heart, but I suppose you would soak it! Soak it in His Word! Soak it in His presence! Make Him my priority!
Father,
I am one who has allowed myself to live far beneath your provision for my life. I've allowed the cares of this world to take priority over your things, and have thus developed a hard heart. I ask your forgiveness and your help today that I could begin anew to soak my heart and allow you to soften it. I've allowed hurt and bitterness to build a wall around my heart and separate me from You and Your people. Help me to simply soak in you today.

Today, I went to check on the animals at Lake Murray, as usual, and I thought I heard a falcon calling. Then, I saw something that looked like a juvenile falcon, but wasn't sure. A few minutes later, I see a vulture flying around and right after that, an adult falcon chases him off. I went over to try to get the falcon's photo, stepping through a bunch of coot parts and a bad a smelly area. But, he flew off and attacked some ducks across the lake. Luckily, the ducks saw him and got a good head start. However he, and the other bird, were very persistent. At one point, I saw something hit the water, but I think it was a ruddy duck or coot taking a dive. As far as I know, no one was hurt and I didn't see the falcons again (or get a picture).
Right under where the falcons were hanging out were about 15 ducks including Quacker, Peaches and her mates and daughters and some ducks that Project Wildlife released earlier this year. Here is one of the ducks that almost became a victim:

145,478,"By Rob Taylor
I lived in a village of townhouses, each separate with four bedrooms, one or two bathrooms, a kitchen and a living room. Depending on where you were in the village, you could have anywhere from four-six people living in your house. You might also have a single room or a double room. Chances were if you were a student in first or second year, you'd be sharing a room.
I found out that the set-up at my school was unusual when I went to visit my friends who were attending other schools. Most often they lived in dormitory-style residences. On each floor of a large building, about 15-20 students would share a living area with a television and a small kitchen and a group bathroom with shower stalls. The kitchen didn't need to be large, as the students were required to buy into a meal plan from the cafeteria.
In my residence, there were no meal plans. So that meant that while my friends had to dish out about $3,000 more up front for a meal plan, that was money I got to hold on to until I actually bought my food. The drawback was that at the end of the year I had to make choices between a haircut and food. Look through your parent's pictures of when they were in school. Look how big their hair is. I bet most students have to make those kinds of decisions.
On many occasions I had some of my friends over to study at my house because it was conveniently located on campus. I cooked them dinner on the condition that they do dishes after. They all still lived at home and drove to school every day. To my amazement, one of them had never done dishes before and I had to show him how to wash, rinse and dry. These skills, simple housekeeping, shopping, budgeting and cleaning, were things I picked up because I was living in residence. And if I didn't get it right away, so what? I was living with four other guys who were learning too.
For stuff that we couldn't figure out on our own, we had dons to help us. The dons were upper-year students who lived in residence as well. Primarily they were there to deal with problems that arose after the residence staff left for the day. They had keys to all the houses and the residence offices in case someone lost theirs. They had first aid training in case of medical emergencies and they had some couselling training to help students deal with the inevitable conflicts that come from young people living together. If you had a problem, whether it was with school or with someone you lived with, you could go and see your don. If they couldn't help you, they could point you in the direction of someone who could.
In compensation for the duties the dons performed, they got free rooms on residence for the year, plus training and experience that would help them later on in their lives.
There are lots of other good things about living in residence, but for the sake of brevity, I'll just mention two more.
The first was the proximity of my home to the school. If I had a 9 a.m. class, I could roll out of bed at 8:30 and be in my seat, showered, combed and with a tea in hand, by 8:55. If I went drinking at the campus pub, I didn't have to worry about getting home safe. I was home. If I needed a change of location for studying, I had a whole school to hide in. If I got a bunch of books home for an essay and realized I had forgotten a key volume, I could just walk back and pick it up from the library (as long as it was before midnight). And last, but not least, if we ran out of toilet paper, there was a whole school full of well-stocked bathrooms to choose from. This may not seem important to you now, but it will. Trust me.
The second good thing about residence is that something is always going on in residence.
One afternoon during my last spring in school, I was making the usual five-minute walk from school to home through the residence village. People were sitting on picnic tables in front of their homes, playing guitar, talking, studying and relaxing. And because we were neighbours and had been for a whole year, we all knew each other. I didn't get home for two hours because I stopped at one house, talked to some people and then went to the next house.
That's what I miss most about living in residence, I think. Sometimes, when I'm walking through the corridors of my apartment building, I think about just opening a door at random, like I would have on campus, and walking in and sitting down. Maybe the people inside would be happy to see me. Maybe they'd talk to me about Third World debt, or the price, both economically and morally, of an oil-based economy, or how close the 1997 XF11 asteroid will come to hitting the earth.
Or maybe they'll stare at me blankly.
Or maybe they'll have a really, really big dog..",What is the name of the village where Rob Taylor lived during his school years?,This question cannot be answered.,False,0,"By Rob Taylor

Citizen editor
Jennifer Stewart Griffith returned to Weston last week to visit her mother and get some relief from the blazing Safford, Ariz. summer.
The Citizen had a chance to visit with her about her latest book, “Big in Japan.”
Griffith will be at The Preston Citizen bookstore for a book signing on July 27, from 2-4 p.m.
Drawing from her experience and knowledge as an LDS missionary who served in Japan, Griffith tells the story of a big Texan named Buck Cooper who ends up going to Japan with his parents.
Cooper is obese and invisible to his colleagues and to the girl of his dreams, he is way below parr. Buck’s entire life is about fitting in, a feat he is always trying to overcome.
His life takes a turn when attends a sumo match and gets called out of the audience to battle a veteran of the sumo sport. He wins and gets recruited to train for a sumo organization. The book chronicles his journey to find love and acceptance.
Griffith said the book is not based on anyone in particular, but is about a nobody wanting to become a somebody.
“I tried to take people on trip to Japan in their mind, writing fiction is not going to change anyone’s life, but I can give them an escape. I can take people to another place away from their day-to-day life,” she said.
The USU English graduate said, “It was so much fun to write and the plot is different enough readers will hopefully enjoy. A sumo wrestler and romance, it’s not like any book you’ve read.”
Preston will get the first peek at the book. It will be at The Preston Citizen bookstore even before the publishers launch their campaign promoting, “Big in Japan.”

Citizen editor
Jennifer Stewart Griffith returned to Weston last week to visit her mother and get some relief from the blazing Safford, Ariz. summer.
The Citizen had a chance to visit with her about her latest book, “Big in Japan.”
Griffith will be at The Preston Citizen bookstore for a book signing on July 27, from 2-4 p.m.
Drawing from her experience and knowledge as an LDS missionary who served in Japan, Griffith tells the story of a big Texan named Buck Cooper who ends up going to Japan with his parents.
Cooper is obese and invisible to his colleagues and to the girl of his dreams, he is way below parr. Buck’s entire life is about fitting in, a feat he is always trying to overcome.
His life takes a turn when attends a sumo match and gets called out of the audience to battle a veteran of the sumo sport. He wins and gets recruited to train for a sumo organization. The book chronicles his journey to find love and acceptance.
Griffith said the book is not based on anyone in particular, but is about a nobody wanting to become a somebody.
“I tried to take people on trip to Japan in their mind, writing fiction is not going to change anyone’s life, but I can give them an escape. I can take people to another place away from their day-to-day life,” she said.

Find an update from Rappahannock Electric Cooperative in Emily Piontek’s December 2020 blog about how Virginians can get involved in their electric cooperatives.
Former Sierra Club Virginia Chair Seth Heald has been a member-owner of Virginia’s Rappahannock Electric Cooperative in the northeastern part of the state for more than nine years. He has become an outspoken critic of the co-op’s board of directors’ lack of transparency. Rappahannock board meetings are closed to the public, meeting minutes are not made available and board compensation is kept secret.
According to Heald, member-owners that mail in signed proxy forms are entered for a chance to win prizes, and there are typically thousands of blank ballots. The board treats each blank ballot as an invitation to vote on that member-owner’s behalf, and then selects a single candidate for all the blank ballots to count towards. Heald contends this practice — which generally determines the election outcome — is “unfair and undemocratic.”
In 2017, Rappahannock attempted a $22.2 million rate increase, which included doubling the residential grid access fee. This type of fee, which is charged regardless of how much electricity is used, disproportionately affects low-income households and discourages homeowner solar and energy efficiency improvements.
After intervention from Sierra Club Virginia and the state attorney general, the State Corporation Commission instead approved a 40 percent increase to the fixed charge, which is now $14. Deciding it was time for reform, Heald banded with other member-owners and solar advocacy organization Solar United Neighbors of Virginia to form the member-owner advocacy group Repower REC.
In April 2018, the group informed Rappahannock of their intent to put three bylaw amendments up for a vote at the co-op’s 2019 annual meeting. The amendments would open board meetings to the public, reform board election procedures and allow the public to see how much board members were paid.
But when Repower REC asked the co-op for the necessary paperwork to begin collecting the required 500 signatures to put the amendments on the ballot, the Rappahannock board of directors refused.
So, in August, three Repower REC members filed a petition with the Virginia State Corporation Commission, alleging that the co-op was breaking state law by withholding the form and by requiring the signatures at all. Rappahannock categorically denied the allegations, and the case will be heard by Virginia’s State Corporation Commission on Dec. 11.
“I’m hopeful that we will, at a minimum, get the petition form,” says Heald. “The trouble is we need to submit our petition signatures by around Feb. 1, and the 500 signatures are required to be spread fairly evenly around [the co-op’s] 22 Virginia counties.” He noted that the board’s reluctance may delay the vote on the amendments until 2020.
Soon after Heald filed the complaint, all of the 12 other electric cooperatives in Virginia intervened in the case to oppose the reforms, including Powell Valley Electric, which also serves part of Tennessee.
“I’m hopeful, I think our case is strong,” Heald says. “But it is concerning to see all of the electric co-ops in the entire state piling on to oppose some reasonable reforms from three co-op members.”
Regardless, Heald is undeterred. “This is a long process,” Heald says. “It’s not something that you can do in three months or six months — but we are growing and we’re planning to keep at it.
“If you’re not involved, then you’re leaving it to other people to control what’s happening at your utilities,” he adds. “The only way to ensure that your voice is heard is to be active and engaged and inform yourself of what’s going on, and our co-op really makes it hard to do that.” — By Kevin Ridder

Take Care: When you’re unwell,
do you allow others to take care of you,
or do you prefer to soldier on alone?
What does it take for you to ask for help?
I have a unique relationship with my health. Can a relationship be marked by a complete lack of communication? Half the time I am unaware that I am sick so I just carry on. Finding out something is broken, requires xrays because a broken bone feels the same to me as a simple bruise. If I do notice I am unwell then I will just soldier on – there may be some moaning, groaning and whining but essentially I just keep going. Oddly, I know when I am really sick I have this irresistible urge to clean the house. All of it, immediately!
I get frustrated when people try to help me. It makes me feel incapable or dependent and being sick is already breaking my spirit. I hate feeling even more vulnerable than normal. I get very grumpy and hubby often just has to lay down the law. Like at the moment with my ankle being injured Hubby is being very clear that I use the crutches and slow down. Crutches and housework are incompatible, let me tell you!
I frequently end up in an ambulance on the way to hospital because I didn’t notice and it got so bad I don’t protest Hubby calling for help. I HATE the pain scale because with a high pain threshold and fibromyalgia I am always in pain. I can rarely differentiate the specific pains because I lump them all together and unconsciously suppress them. If I say I am in pain – why is that never enough? I also get sick of comments that I look well – what I look is PTSD affect and it doesn’t change. I refuse to fake what they believe to be the “appropriate” look for what is wrong with me.
When I am admitted to hospital I get out early. And yes hospital feels like prison to me. I explain that I have a nurse at home but not that this nurse is actually me. Hubby keeps quiet lol he is only so brave… I always prefer being at home to recover and away from prying eyes – which I consider the medical profession to be. I ma just used to dealing alone and HATE being helped to function.
I was charmed recently when my mother – in – law sent me a gorgeous get well card. It was such a surprise and for all my grumpiness I really loved this acknowledgement of my current disposition. I have it sitting beside me on the couch my current second home after the bed at the moment… sigh. It makes me smile each time I see it.
I am not sure I get to the point of asking for help. I can go to the doctor on his request for a follow up and be half dead and still not refer to my condition. I just hate acknowledging illness or pain or I just don’t realise. More often than not someone else points out I am sick and need a doctor or I collapse and that forces the issue.
I am working on this and it is or it feels really slow. When my ankle was diagnosed as having a hairline fracture it was the only part of me not hurting after I collapsed to the floor. I just laughed … which of course just confused the nurse. At that stage I had given up on explaining the pain I was in and how it would not match my affect … plus the meds I was on keep my mood and blood pressure fairly even, whatever the stress.
I often reply, I am f.i.n.e. to questions on how I am feeling. The funny thing is that people believe it even when I am standing in front of them on crutches and grimacing. I guess we believe and hear what we need to, even in that moment when we are with someone and could be listening to their words, rather than interpreting our meaning in them.

The Gundam franchise is big, there's no denying that. The whole freaking franchise is very overwhelming. I mean it spawned 11 TV shows, several OVAs, theatrical films and specials. I'm not even counting the countless sidestory mangas, video games and novels that gets released mostly every month...
Alright, here you can continue discussing the Gundam series. =) Have fun and play nice, kiddies. I don't want to come with the rolled up newspaper and swat you across your head every time you don't behave. <33

Thought I'd ask the AF Gundam crowd this; if you were a Gundam pilot (from any era in the metaseries), what kind of weapons and abilites would your Mobile Suit have?
Simply discuss your favorite female characters from any Gundam series.
What Gundam series is your favorite? I bet that most will say, Gundam Wing, as I will, but I have to say that Gundam SEED comes in a close second.
This is quite possibly my favorite anime. How much do you guys like it?
...were should I start?
Random idea, but whatever. So AF, what would you do?
What's everyone's thoughts on the live action G Savior? I know it's probably blasphemy, but it's the only Gundam thing I've ever seen, except for part of a random episode of Gundam Wing. I've been interested in watching the series from the beginning.
List your 3 favorite mobile suits here. Use template lolol

Ok.. i believe this quote im trying to find is in the Endless Waltz version of Gundam Wing that played in the USA. It happend (i think) durring a fight between Zero and Epsilon. It was something Relena (or one of the other female characters) said.
Unless im completely mixing things up it was...
So what got you hooked onto the series/genera?
Gundam Wing was my first exposure to anything Gundam related. I want to say I was in eighth grade when I saw Optimus Prime hype up the series. Around episode 10 is where I would say I was hooked.....I think that is the episode were Heero Yuy does...
classic gundam
all of first gundam series here...
i have been watching gundam since i was small and ive been buying them up as i go. so far my last gundam is Gundam 00. i started watching unicorn and i must say the character animation is different from the animator of seed an 00. seems closer to that of the original mobile suit gundam.
anyway...
For me it would probably be Relena, Hilde, or Noin. If you don't know who Hilde is, she's this chick who looks similar to Noin.

The Gundam franchise is big, there's no denying that. The whole freaking franchise is very overwhelming. I mean it spawned 11 TV shows, several OVAs, theatrical films and specials. I'm not even counting the countless sidestory mangas, video games and novels that gets released mostly every month...
Alright, here you can continue discussing the Gundam series. =) Have fun and play nice, kiddies. I don't want to come with the rolled up newspaper and swat you across your head every time you don't behave. <33

All discussion about the Gundam series goes here. :D Please leave it as that. Maybe we won't have a billion thread floating around. ^_^

Thought I'd ask the AF Gundam crowd this; if you were a Gundam pilot (from any era in the metaseries), what kind of weapons and abilites would your Mobile Suit have?
Simply discuss your favorite female characters from any Gundam series.
What Gundam series is your favorite? I bet that most will say, Gundam Wing, as I will, but I have to say that Gundam SEED comes in a close second.
This is quite possibly my favorite anime. How much do you guys like it?
...were should I start?
Random idea, but whatever. So AF, what would you do?
What's everyone's thoughts on the live action G Savior? I know it's probably blasphemy, but it's the only Gundam thing I've ever seen, except for part of a random episode of Gundam Wing. I've been interested in watching the series from the beginning.
List your 3 favorite mobile suits here. Use template lolol
Name: ZGMF-X19A Infinity Justice

Ok.. i believe this quote im trying to find is in the Endless Waltz version of Gundam Wing that played in the USA. It happend (i think) durring a fight between Zero and Epsilon. It was something Relena (or one of the other female characters) said.
Unless im completely mixing things up it was...
So what got you hooked onto the series/genera?
Gundam Wing was my first exposure to anything Gundam related. I want to say I was in eighth grade when I saw Optimus Prime hype up the series. Around episode 10 is where I would say I was hooked.....I think that is the episode were Heero Yuy does...
classic gundam
all of first gundam series here...
i have been watching gundam since i was small and ive been buying them up as i go. so far my last gundam is Gundam 00. i started watching unicorn and i must say the character animation is different from the animator of seed an 00. seems closer to that of the original mobile suit gundam.
anyway...
For me it would probably be Relena, Hilde, or Noin. If you don't know who Hilde is, she's this chick who looks similar to Noin.
Episode 4 titled ""At The Bottom Of The Gravity Well"" will be released on November 12, 2011 for the PSN. The DVD and BD release will be on December 2.
Synopsis:
Characters and mecha that will appear in the episode:
Is there any Gundam mobile suit that can seat two people? Or has it only been one person, which is the pilot?

With the release of the 2014 OIA slate, MidWeek‘s East Oahu Islander breaks down the respective schedules for Anuenue, Kalani and Kaimuki in the White conference as well as Division I Kaiser. (The Cougars were promoted after winning the OIA White as well as the DII state title last November.)
Anuenue Na Koa
2013 record: 0-9 overall, 0-8 in OIA White
2014 games: Waimea (at Kamehameha) Aug. 9, Radford (at Roosevelt) Aug. 15, Kaimuki (at Kaiser) Aug. 23, Kalani (at Kaiser) Aug. 29, at Pearl City Sept. 5, Kalaheo (at Kailua) Sept. 13, at Nanakuli Sept. 19, at Roosevelt Sept. 26, Waialua (at Kaiser) Oct. 4.
Key stretch: Pearl City, Kalaheo, Nanakuli
Must-see game 1: Kalani Must-see game 2: Waialua Game to be on upset-alert for: Roosevelt
Schedule breakdown: Having a bye in week nine could be an asset, as a week off just before the playoffs can help Anuenue prepare for the post-season. Road trips to Pearl City and Nanakuli appear to be the meat of the schedule. The good news is that Anuenue won’t have to travel to Radford, as the playing field is at Roosevelt.
Kalani Falcons
2013 record: 6-4 overall, 6-2 in OIA White
2014 games: Waialua (at Kaiser) Aug. 16, Kalaheo (at Kailua) Aug. 23, Anuenue (at Kaiser) Aug. 29, at Roosevelt Sept. 5, Radford (at Kaiser) Sept. 12, Kaimuki (at Kaiser) Sept. 20, at Pearl City Oct. 3, Nanakuli (at Kaiser) Oct. 11.
Key stretch: Radford, Kaimuki, Pearl City
Must-see game 1: Kaimuki
Must-see game 2: Pearl City
Game to be on upset-alert for: Anuenue
Schedule breakdown: With winnable games in succession against Waialua, Kalaheo, Anuenue and Roosevelt, there’s a chance for a nice run by the Falcons over the season’s first month. The road gets bumpier on the back end of the slate with tough games against Radford, Pearl City and Nanakuli.
Kaimuki Bulldogs
2013 record: 1-7 overall, 0-6 in OIA Red East
2014 schedule: Anuenue (at Kaiser) Aug. 23, at Pearl City Aug. 29, Radford (at Kaiser) Sept. 6, at Nanakuli Sept. 13, Kalani (at Kaiser) Sept. 20, at Waialua Sept. 26, Kalaheo (at Kaiser) Oct. 3, at Roosevelt Oct. 10
Key stretch: Pearl City, Radford, Nanakuli
Must-see game 1: Kalani Must-see game 2: Radford Game to be on upset-alert for: Waialua
Schedule breakdown: For Kaimuki, the difference between a good and a great season may be tied to how well it performs in true road games at Pearl City, Nanakuli, Waialua and Roosevelt. Weeks two and three also will be demanding with Pearl City and Radford back to back.
Kaiser Cougars
2013 record: 13-1 overall, 7-1 in OIA White
2014 games: Aiea Aug. 15, Waianae Aug. 22, Waipahu Sept. 5, McKinley (at Roosevelt) Sept. 12, Kahuku Sept. 19, at Castle Sept. 26, at Leilehua Oct. 3.
Key stretch: Kahuku, Castle, Leilehua
Must-see game 1: Kahuku Must-see game 2: Waianae Game to be on upset-alert for: Waipahu
Schedule breakdown: The back end of the slate is as demanding as any team in the OIA with a home date against Kahuku and road games against Castle and Leilehua to close out the season. Kaiser also will open its home schedule with a flourish with back-to-back games against Aiea and Waianae.

164,364," how varied the language of the medium can be and its interpretation.” Since then, the Kolkata-based photographer has created visually appealing series that vividly capture the sights, sounds and people of his city. In his ongoing solo show, “Velocity of darkness” which is displayed at IIC until August 24, Bivas has captured the “invisible” people of Kolkata. In a candid talk he takes us through his artistic trajectory. The show is curated by Ina Puri.
- 1. You have captured the invisible people of Kolkata in this exhibition. What was the reason for bringing out the humane side of the city through your lens?
I have been born and brought up in Kolkata. My father the surrealist Bikash Bhattacharjee saw and represented the people of Kolkata who were “invisible”. He saw the human behind the multitude and told their stories. However, his narrative was not limited to the personal stories, but the underlying socio-economic-political situation of the city was amply represented in his work. It is from here somewhere in the subconscious the language to see the city in this light came about.
As I grew older, I did not see “The City of Joy”, though don’t get me wrong the city does have a fabulous heritage of culture, and heart, but the turmoil of a city whose history is so textured that it can leave scars. And, with time, the humane can get relegated to the background and a maddening mode to survive kicks in. It is this attitude that somewhere bothers me. I wished to tell this aspect of the city which is generally not captured by many photographers, who work on Kolkata.
- Your photographs have a sudden urgency and distortion. Why have you distort the faces of your subjects?
For this project I felt that composition and other structures like sharpness and aesthetic tone was not important rather I wanted to convey the mood of what I was capturing. The subjects of my work are all people who make up the mass of the city, they are important but in the grander scheme they are almost a number that makes up a multitude. Their stories are of uncertainty and chaos, and hence, the normalcy of life skewed, with goals of life “strange”. This is what I wished to capture through my work.
- 3. From the time you started the series, Leaving Behind My House until now, there has been a gradual progression in your photographs. Can you elaborate on how you are using photography as a medium for expression?
All my work is personal. I have always been attracted by the surreal or the abstract. Previously there was an escape into the grander nature through my works such a ‘Leaving Behind my House’, a metaphysical thirst to delve into the macroscopic. However, from that macroscopic the microscopic world that revolves around I could not ignore and it kept bothering me, and from this, the work has progressed into its current state where the reflections on the other individuals that surround me also tells something about myself as well. This is what is attracting me further in the future.
- Often, people see photography as a medium which reflects immediate concerns. Does your present exhibition also, in a way, looks at people who are often neglected and not cared for?
I believe this view on photography is relevant as the problems of this part of the world are of this nature somewhat. But of course it is not that simple and other aspects to this section of this world do exist and they need attention, focus and representation. However, I do not wish to be literal and document concerns. My work is more personal, it is a personal reflection on what I see. It is my attempt at sort of writing poetry through photography It does have it socio-economic-political situational context but generally it is more personal, a reflective take on the state of the city.
- Any kind of visual art is often not seen as a sustainable medium of income. While the same can’t be hold true for liberal arts, as we have auction houses and art fairs across the world to give artists a good platform for exposure. Do you think that photography is still not taken seriously by art lovers or faces some prejudice?
Generally, photography in our country has been documentary, editorial and street photography. I believe the relationship between the common man on the streets and photography has been either through the press or through personal family photographs. Very few have seen it as an art form, barring decorative photographs.
Also, there is still I believe a lack of awareness as to how much work can go into creating a photography project when people feel you can get an image so easily through clicking a button. Whilst the common belief is other art forms require serious “skill” and “craftsmanship”.I also see that Indian art has its history in the folk or craft. Hence, that aesthetic is still hugely appealing, whereas photography is a language which is unfamiliar and sometimes indecipherable. Altogether I feel photography as an art form is still under-appreciated, and its proliferation extremely niche.
- What are you working on next?
My next plan is to finish designing the book on this project and hopefully get it to publication, also if possible take this show to other cities or abroad. I am also working on another new project on Kolkata in colour. It is a project based on the hidden aspects of a city. I have just started and it will again take a couple of years to complete.

Do you think that photography is still not taken seriously by art lovers or faces some prejudice?
Generally, photography in our country has been documentary, editorial and street photography. I believe the relationship between the common man on the streets and photography has been either through the press or through personal family photographs. Very few have seen it as an art form, barring decorative photographs.
Also, there is still I believe a lack of awareness as to how much work can go into creating a photography project when people feel you can get an image so easily through clicking a button. Whilst the common belief is other art forms require serious “skill” and “craftsmanship”.I also see that Indian art has its history in the folk or craft. Hence, that aesthetic is still hugely appealing, whereas photography is a language which is unfamiliar and sometimes indecipherable. Altogether I feel photography as an art form is still under-appreciated, and its proliferation extremely niche.
- What are you working on next?
My next plan is to finish designing the book on this project and hopefully get it to publication, also if possible take this show to other cities or abroad. I am also working on another new project on Kolkata in colour. It is a project based on the hidden aspects of a city. I have just started and it will again take a couple of years to complete.
 What is the main theme of the photographer's next project? This question cannot be answered.",956

Right above the core-mantle boundary beneath Africa and central Pacific, seismological observations have revealed regions of reduced shear velocity, referred as Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVP). Their seismic structure, influence on the mantle dynamics and genesis is largely unknown. They likely correspond to dense, chemically distinct material accumulates on the core-mantle boundary.
To investigate the eastern border of the Pacific LLSVP we processed data from natural earthquakes using the IRIS catalogue and Wilber II tool. We calculated differential travel times between S diffracted and SKS arrivals, as well as S diffracted and synthetic seismograms calculated with respect to the PREM velocity reference model. Then we employed a simple ray-tracing algorithm to determine the velocity change in certain areas of the ray path. We calculated deviations from the PREM model for depths of range between 1000 and 2800 km, and the optimal LLSVP border. The results were compared with the data for the southern border of the African LLSVP.
In the geodynamic chapter we wanted to link seismological observations with results from numerical modeling. We used a two-dimensional model of mantle convection and calculated dense material distribution in the lower thermal boundary layer for different densities, Rayleigh number values and radiogenic heat productions. For certain density differences between the convecting layer material (the mantle) and dense material in the lowermost layer we obtained two dinstinct regions of accumulation that may correspond to the observed LLSVPs.",What is the genesis of Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVP)?,This question cannot be answered.,False,0,"Master of Science Dissartation

Art style: The presentation in this game is solid. Right from the intro as the title sequence changes from black and white to colour, the art style impressed me. Characters in the game are unique and colourful, with a cartoonish look. The game pieces and art in between levels are also impressive and makes it really feel like a quality title.
Bonuses: Besides the usual playing and progressing to the next level, the matching gameplay is broken up by a spinning wheel between levels. While there’s not much to do but hit to stop it from spinning and collect your prize, you can get yourself quite a few different bonuses to mix up the gameplay. It was a nice break from the matching game and I found myself looking forwards to it and the end of each level.
Dislikes
Not challenging: I didn’t find the gameplay particularly engaging. For one, this was because the genre of match three is overdone. But I also found it to be a bit too easy. Matches were always obvious and quick to do. I’d get stuck the odd time, but then by dropping a bomb it returned to being easy right away again.
While there was nothing innovative about the game itself, I thought the art style was unique and interesting. I always looked forward to the bonuses between rounds, and the easy gameplay made it ideal to pull out for quick rounds. If you haven’t tired of the genre, give Friki Tricks a try.

180,582,"Conceptualizing Inclusive Growth
A two-day consultation organized by the Planning Commission and the UNDP aimed to arrive at a conceptual understanding of inclusive growth and the key determinants of an inclusive growth framework that can guide countries, development agencies and communities in the coming years.
Inclusive development strategies will require more inclusive growth processes that involve those on the ""wrong side"" of the income divide say participants of a UNDP-Planning Commission consultation in New Delhi.

New Delhi, 24 October, 2011: ""Inclusive growth means much more than poverty reduction. Issues of equity, both inter-generational and between rich and poor, regional inequities and the needs of minorities need to be factored in,"" said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission.
He was speaking at a two-day consultation organised by the Planning Commission and the United Nations Development Programme which began in New Delhi today. years.
According to Ajay Chhibber, UN Assistant Secretary General, UNDP Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific, ""Special affirmative action programmes that address discrimination will not be sufficient to achieve inclusive growth if the overall growth process is not intrinsically inclusive, i.e. if it does not encourage employment or reduce rural-urban growth disparities.""
As concern mounts over the need for policies that promote economic growth and lead to better human development outcomes for people, Patrice Coeur-Bizot, United Nations Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, India, said, ""There is now a growing recognition that countries need to simultaneously focus on economic growth and socio-economic progress, and it cannot be assumed that the former will pave the way for the latter.""
Tracing the trajectory of theoretical frameworks to understand growth and development, Rathin Roy, Director, International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth said, "" Inclusive growth processes target better inclusion of citizens – as workers, entrepreneurs and consumers of public and private goods - in the delivery of growth. An inclusive growth strategy views growth as a target, and relies on the intensive use of factors of production of groups on the wrong side of the income distribution divide such as labour.""
The resounding message emanating from day one of the consultation is that a more inclusive development strategy will require a more inclusive growth process itself. Unequal growth accompanied by social programmes for those left behind will not be enough. Social policies play a critical role in the interventions that can enable people to participate on the ""right side of the divide.""

181,63,"David Moyes has had to endure a season of struggle since taking over the helm at Manchester United following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. However, this weekend's defeat to arch-rivals Liverpool was perhaps the lowest point for him and his players this season.
Liverpool quite simply outclassed United all over the pitch. They played with much more confidence, pace and skill whilst United lacked creativity or desire.
The final 3-0 scoreline could have been far worse and such humiliation in their own back yard would have been unthinkable under Ferguson's reign. This season it is not necessarily a surprise.
Now United must pick themselves up as they face a crucial week which could go a long way to deciding the fate of David Moyes as their manager. United face a crucial second leg Champions League game against Greek side Olympiakos where they need to overturn a shock 2-0 first leg defeat.
Then, next Monday, United face Manchester rivals City in a game that could highlight the now big difference between the two teams. United and Moyes surely need to not only improve their performances but will also need to win at least one of these games.
In a week's time could we see Moyes on the verge of being sacked if results do not go his way in these big games?
United have been very patient this season, as have their supporters, but you have to wonder how far they are willing to see their decline continue under Moyes especially when they look at their main rivals, City and Liverpool, and see the great strides that these two clubs are making at the moment.
United have very little hope of success this season. The only silverware on offer is the Champions League but even if they can overturn their first leg defeat in Greece it is highly unlikely that they will be able to progress to the final given their current form.
Moyes, at the very least, will hope for an improvement in performances during the next week and United's supporters will want to see signs that will give them hope for the future. If not we could well be seeing the end of what will be a very short reign as United manager for Moyes.

Moyes, at the very least, will hope for an improvement in performances during the next week and United's supporters will want to see signs that will give them hope for the future. If not we could well be seeing the end of what will be a very short reign as United manager for Moyes.
Another humiliation at Old Trafford could prove too much for everyone connected What is the crucial game Manchester United needs to win after their defeat to Liverpool?

It's also a nice treat to use the time spent sleeping to complete a long journey. I went to bed speaking French, using francs as currency, and woke up in a new country, one that speaks Spanish and spends pesetas.
The Madrid subway system is pretty straight forward, much less confusing than the Paris metro. Not far from the subway is the pensione where I will stay tonight. The woman who answers the door is kind enough, but not overly friendly. This is a type of bed and breakfast accommodation, without the breakfast, and only costs $11 for the room.
With my knapsack safely tucked away, I explore Madrid with the help of the map from tourist information at the train station. Madrid is a beautiful city to wander in, with its lovely fountains. I take my time figuring out where to go next in a gorgeous park, full of lakes, trees and a crystal house.
Around the city are vendors with little carts, much like the hot dog carts back in Toronto. Here you can buy a drink, which is anything from coke-a-cola to a martini. There is a little seating area that is available for an extra 100 pesetas.
Spanish coffee is strong, like the coffee in Paris, but with a slightly different taste. The man at the bistro suggests I add lots of milk, stir and then sprinkle the sugar on top. The result is very tasty. While I enjoy my coffee, I discuss some of Spain's more popular festivals, like Tomatina, and the Running of the Bulls with another traveler.
Madrid turns out to be more of a culinary experience, with so many interesting flavours of food and drink to discover. A small restaurant prepares perfectly spiced ravioli, served with delicious wine for my post city sight seeing dinner.
Back at the pensione, and exhausted from a day of walking and eating, I flop into my bed. The mattress consumes me, folding up on either side like a fluffy, thick hammock. I have been transformed into a human hot dog, wrapped up a snug bun, covered with a blanket the exact same shade as French's mustard.

188,316,"I have never been one for decorating my house, much to the chagrin of my mother who changes everything down to her curtains just about every season. When she moved back to Idaho several years ago, she stayed with my brother for a month and drove him nuts with all her ideas of what he needed/should do to decorate his house. He still bitches about that. When James died and she saw my house for the first time, she offered some suggestions as to what I should do with it which I just ignored. For me, it is not so much the decor that matters but the feel. And my house feels like a home. Even with James gone, you can still feel the love when you walk in the door. (Once you get past the excitement of the boys, who you would think have never seen people before, that is).
But as part of the grief recovery process, I do feel it wouldn't hurt to add a few feminine touches here and there as part of that whole making the house ""mine"" instead of ""ours"" thing. My friend offered to help me with that, which I wisely did not tell my mother when she told me about this season's curtain scheme (blue, I think. I wasn't really listening). I would have gotten another lecture on how I need to get some pretty curtains. My mom is very big on her curtains. I don't want curtains-I have really cool wood blinds. Well, they look like wood anyway. My friend and I have looked at a couple of stores and I have pointed out a few things I like so she is keeping that in the back of her mind when she is out and about. She changes her house around from time to time and it always looks nice so I trust her. And yes, she does have curtains. But just on one window. She has blinds on the rest.
Today on my way home, I stopped to get a birthday present for a friend and ended up getting a few things for myself. I really shouldn't have spent the money, but I justified it by everything I bought for myself being 20% off.
The first thing I got was a 12"" x 12"" square wall hanging with a seashell in the middle that says ""It's not what you look at that matters,"" down most of the left side and ""it's what you see."" across most of the bottom. The shell looks like it is sitting on a antique yellow fabric square and the background behind it is different blues and browns. I am going to put this in my master bathroom, which is light blue with a darker marble looking blue counter. I have always thought some sort of nautical theme would work in there. My real reason for putting this in there, however, is so I will see it when I am getting ready in the morning and remind myself to really look at the person I am-not just the package I come in.
The second thing I got is a small plaque (about 9"" x 4"") that has a small blue butterfly in the lower left corner and a weird purple and blue flower with a green stem and leaves on the right side that says ""Life is a journey not a Destination"" on the left above the butterfly. I am not yet sure where this is going to go; I am thinking maybe by James' picture and his urn for now. It is a reminder to take the time to enjoy life now and not worry so much about getting to my future.
The last plaque I got is also small-about 5"" x 7""- and has a daisy at the top and one of my new found favorite quotes in the middle: ""Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain."" It says Dance across the bottom. As any fan of Grey's Anatomy can tell you, sometimes you just have to dance it out. I am thinking about finding a spot here in the office for this one. This is my reminder to learn to find and appreciate the good in life even when it all seems to be going downhill.
There was one other plaque I was really tempted to get. It says ""I am not a fast cook and I am not a slow cook. I am a half-fast cook."" I'm actually a pretty decent cook; I just thought that was really funny, especially when you say it out loud. The sale goes for another couple of days. I may have to go back for that.
With what little I have done so far, I have come to realize that no matter what I put on the walls or how many rooms I paint, James' essence will still be here and I am more than fine with that. It's what makes my house my home. But making my home a little more girly (I am SO not a girly girl) won't hurt anything and could actually be fun. But don't tell Mom I said that.

189,443,"I received a copy of a new book published by Packt publishing about mobile security. As mobile devices are more and more targeted by attackers, it was a good idea to publish a book on this hot topic. Written by a group of people working for IBM, the book covers a broad range of topics that can be grouped in two main sections:
- A review of problems and threats affecting mobile devices
- Tips and procedure to protect your mobile devices
Across the book, the two main mobile OS are covered (iOS and Android).
The first part (chapters 1 to 4) covers all the security issues that we can face when using a mobile device (and this can be extended to any “connected” device to be honest). Chapter 1 (“Living in a mobile world“) describes how our lifes changed thanks to (our “because of“) our mobile devices. We are always connected and this makes us more vulnerable to attacks. The second chapter (“Users and Mobile Device Management”) focuses on the solution and procedures that can be deployed to control mobile devices, mainly MDM solutions but also all the requirements around it: procedures, policies. Note that a “MUM” (“Mobile User Management“) could also be very useful in some cases. The third chapters reviews our privacy: “Small Word, Big consequences“. This is maybe the most interesting one. If you just have one chapter to propose to non-IT people, it’s this one! It covered all the issues that we may face regarding our privacy with a lot of references to real cases. Different types of attacks are reviewed in the next chapter: Scams, malwares, SMS spoofing, Social engineering, Phishing, Cloud computer (yes – it’s considered as a threat) and viruses.
Then comes the second section with more defensive advices. the fifth chapter is called “Protecting your mobile devices“. Basically, it’s an overview of all the features implemented by a classic MDM solution: Strong passwords policies, encryption, how to use good apps, remote wiping a device. I’ve to mention some good tips covered like:
- What to do in case of one of your account has been compromised?
- How to create strong passwords? (honestly, nothing new)
- What are the signs that a device has been compromised?
The next chapter looks a bit stranger to me. It covers the support and warranty of mobile phones. I don’t see a direct relation with mobile security! Maybe some interesting advices can be found here if you’re fighting with your mobile operator or manufacturer. The most important fact to keep in mind is the gap between a device owned by a company (owned == supported) and a personal device used in your job (“BYOD“). Same idea for the chapter 7 which covers the baby boomers and teens. It reviews the impact of mobile technologies on children and young adults. It also give some advices to parents who want to make mobile devices safer for their kids.
The last chapter covers the case when you’ve been hacked. How to get your life back? “Your life” is not exaggerated because mobile devices contains so much personal information (contacts, emails, sms, pictures, videos, notes, …). This chapter gives tips like:
- How to make a backup?
- Whom to contact in case of suspicious activity?
- How to wipe? (partial vs complete)
Then the book ended with some annexes. The first one cover IBM NotesTraveler, a email push solution for mobile devices. Irrelevant in books like this one which must remain vendor independant (the fact that the authors are working for IBM is not a valid reason). The annexes C gives a checklist of tips to protect your mobile device and the annexe D proposes a template of “Mobile Acceptable User Policy“.
What to conclude? This books contains lot of useful information but you’ve to select them by yourself. If you are only a user, some chapters are worth a read. If you are an IT-guy of looking for a MDM solution, others might be interesting too. I would say: check the table of contents and follow your points of interest!

Okay, so it’s been a few more Saturdays than I expected to get another post up. We’re back in the States and Berlin Diary is on hiatus until we ever make it back there. There is scheming afoot, but nothing that will happen in the short term. In fact, we even trailed off writing off over there in our last week and a half. Too much to do, too little time.
I’ve got a job for the next couple of months, Lisa’s interviewing for work all over the country it seems, and within about two weeks we should hear if we’re going to be able to pitch our Berlin project to a consortium in Norway for funding. I haven’t written about that here and I don’t want to go into any more detail just yet other than to say we’re thrilled with the response we’ve gotten so far. Any more good news and we’ll be beyond thrilled, wherever “beyond thrilled” happens to be.
Also in good news, I’ve finished my current edit/re-draft of The Story of the Story of the Egg and that’s gone out to betas. I’ve started on the query letter and expect to start sending it to agents sometime in the autumn. Good responses from folks so far. The timing with my work is perfect.
It’s a good thing I’ve dropped the folktale to once a week though – as it is I’m barely keeping up.
But in links-world…
Peter Han says he’s not an artist but a designer. He works primarily in chalk and he has no compunction about erasing the work that he creates. There’s a short doc on him at Vimeo, Pardon My Dust. Reminded me in his apparent speed of Lisa’s short doc Giorgio, about an Italian street artist – the trailer is here.
Creepy and photography come together at Atlas Obscure, one of my favorite sites of the past couple of months, with their short piece on Snake Island. If you don’t like the look of snakes, although there’s only one picture of one, don’t click this link. It’s an island infested with golden lancehead vipers – about one snake for every square meter.

If you don’t like the look of snakes, although there’s only one picture of one, don’t click this link. It’s an island infested with golden lancehead vipers – about one snake for every square meter. Their venom boils skin away. Go here (or don’t).
More maps! These are from illustrator Andrew DeGraff, who re-imagines movie plots as treasure maps. Guess the answers – check at the end.

194,537,"Black Lives Matter: Eric Garner’s Death & Questions That Remain
Looking over from the African continent, it has not always been easy for many to fully understand the circumstances of Black Americans or even the history of race relations in the United States. After all, many assume America is a country of freedom, laden with opportunities and wealth for all. However, how does one account for the complaints from the Black American community along with the commensurate apparent disparities in opportunities and treatment?
On July 17, 2014, police officers of the New York Police Department (NYPD) approached 43 year old Eric Garner under the suspicion of hawking cigarettes along the road, an act New York City frowns strongly upon because it undermines their deliberately exorbitant taxation policies on discouraged products. After engaging in an argument with Mr. Garner, who pleaded several times with the officers to “leave him alone,” “I’m minding my business officer, I’m minding my business.” “Every time you see me, you want to mess with me.” His pleas were insufficient to the police who were determined to take him down. He was grappled to the ground and suffocated in a banned chokehold; once again he began to plead, this time for his life. “I can’t breathe,” “I can’t breathe,” “I can’t breathe.” The officers ignored his pleas and pushed his head against the concrete, while his life slowly drifted away from him and out of his reach. It was not long before Garner was pronounced dead.
The fallout was immediate. The primary culprits responsible for killing Garner — Daniel Pantaleo and Justin D’Amico were placed on desk duty. While awaiting a grand jury decision on whether to indict the police officer, the city medical examiner came back with a verdict months later — the death was ruled a homicide. On December 13, 2014, the grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo for Garner’s death. Protests broke out in New York City and across the United States. Highways were blocked off to traffic and protesters peacefully demonstrated in the streets.
It was especially painful to the Black American community, as this failure to indict came shortly after another failure to indict in the death of Ferguson teenager, Michael Brown. In addition to this, 12 year old Tamir Rice from Ohio was gunned down within two seconds of arrival by police officer Tim Loehmann; like every other kid, Tamir was playing by the park with his toy gun when he was shot. Regardless of whoever is right or wrong, in any of these cases, the Black American community has noted a system that has historically targeted them unfairly, especially black men.
There are a number of issues with the Eric Garner case that immediately come to the forefront in the minds of many. First of all, why was Panteleo’s case not taken to trial despite the fact that the medical examiner had clearly ruled Garner’s death a homicide? The New York Police Department (NYPD) had taken steps in July to retrain the police force against the banned chokehold, which clearly shows that Panteleo’s actions implied error, and the presence of very clear video evidence which shows the police officers killing the man while the cameraman protested the unfair arrest. It is understandable that this was the jury’s decision to make, but who were these individuals? Secondly, why was this officer left on the NYPD payroll despite a history of being sued three times in the past for violating the rights of Black Americans? Despite the race or color of the police officers, or even that of the victim’s, there is no reason why this homicide should not have gone to trial. No one should have to die for hawking petty goods along the street — in the grand scheme of things there are more serious atrocities that occur daily but go unnoticed.
What do these recent incidents mean for black men in America? For parents with young sons, will having the talk have to shift from a discussion about the “birds and the bees” to “how to not get shot”?
One thing is certain. The uprising following the deaths of Garner and Brown prove the power of civil society, for better or worse. There remains some hope that all Americans can leverage what has been positive from the demonstrations to promote an understanding of race relations in the United States. Americans of good ethics, including Black Americans need to be more involved in civil society and continue to highlight and celebrate what is positive. Jury duty should never be seen as a chore, but rather a part of the democratic process wherein homicidal officers with a history of poor policing are brought to justice. Further measures recommended include proper training of the police force, the elimination of the irrational fear of black individuals, civil recourse in the case against Pantaleo, and compensation to the Garner family, even though no amount of money can replace the pain from the unnecessary death of a man who was a husband, father and a son. However at the end of the day, change will have to begin at home. Black businesses, families and communities need to rally their support in building a greater sense of community, unity and support while actively challenging negative stereotypes and perceptions.
Black lives do matter. It is important that these measures are taken sooner rather than later, as the next time could be anytime.

About: Pressed powder blush packaged in a plastic compact with a concealed brush applicator and a mirror.
Review: I instantly fell in love with Happy Booster Glow & Mood Boosting Blush - all those pretty pink hearts were just too cute to pass up! It is almost a shame to use the blusher and ruin the pretty design. The blush contains a light to darker variety of pink in complementary tones, all with various amounts of glitter and sheen. At first I was a little worried that it would be too dark as well as it would be way too shiny and glittery, a concern that stems from having combination skin. But I needn’t have worried as it just adds a subtle touch of glow and sheen to my cheeks. As for the colours, even though they look dark in the compact, and I thought that it was better suited to those with darker skin tones. Again I did not need to worry, once applied they appear soft and glowing, very natural and sheer and perfect for those with fair skin. However, it can easily be layered for a more intense look.
The colours in the compact blend together for a nice overall hue to the cheeks, leaving behind a nice radiance as well. For extra pop of colour, or for a darker look, it is easy to simply just sweep the brush over one of the darker hearts and apply it to your cheeks to define and contour, or apply right below the cheekbones for a more defined and dramatic look. The lighter colours work as a highlighter too. The blush is ultra-smooth and light weight. The pigments are so finely milled that it blends easily, and feels comfortable to wear, as well looking natural on the skin. It has great staying power, I find that I do not need to touch up doing the day.
Happy Booster Glow & Mood Boosting Blush is infused with Euphoryl (natural plant extracts) which claim to promote the feeling of happiness by mimicking the effect of endorphins and helping protect the skin from environmental stress. To be very honest, I do not think that using the Happy Booster Glow & Mood Boosting Powder made me any happier - but I do enjoy using it! Happy Booster Glow & Mood Boosting Blush is further more enriched with a violet scent which was the first thing I noticed when I took the powder out if its packaging. The fragrance does not last on my skin at all, and while this is a lovely touch, and does not cause any issues for my skin, I would prefer it to be fragrance free.
Happy Booster Blush is hypo-allergenic, dermatologist approved, non-comedogenic as well as paraben free, which is all fantastic, but again as mentioned above, I also wish that it was perfume free. Happy Booster Glow & Mood Boosting Powder comes in a pink metallic compact that I must admit I find a little too bulky. In saying that, I do not normally carry my blusher around with me for touch ups during the day, so I can certainly see past this. As for the metallic pink colour of the case, I find that it looks a little too girly and cheap. But I do like that it has a compartment containing the little brush as well as a mirror, both of which are handy for touch ups on the go. The brush is half pink and half red and quite cute, although I find that it is a little too stiff. The brush is too small to properly allow you to sweep it over the palette, making it difficult to achieve an even look. I found I got a much nicer and a more even result from using one of my own soft blush brushes. The powder retails for $21.95, and all in all it is a fantastic buy, that gives my face a much needed pop of colour as we head into spring. I highly recommend it, and would consider purchasing in the future.
