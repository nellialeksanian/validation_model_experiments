399,525,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"On the stage of a TV studio in Phnom Penh, Cambodian-American Ly Sivhong is telling an engrossed audience a tragic, but familiar, story. On April 17, 1975 -- 40 years ago today -- life as Ly knew it was shattered when her hometown, the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, fell to the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime of the Communist Party of Kampuchea. Ly, then 13, was separated from her mother and two of her sisters who, along with virtually the entire population of Phnom Penh -- about two million people -- were sent on a forced march into the countryside to work. Ly never saw them again, nor learned what happened to them. But about 20,000 people died from execution, starvation or exhaustion during this exodus at gunpoint, according to war crimes prosecutors; the others were subjected to slave labor in rural camps once they reached their destination, where many met similar fates. The urban evacuation marked the first phase in the Khmer Rouge's revolutionary program of social engineering, intended to establish a new order -- free of money, family ties, religion, education, property and foreign influence. Aimed at creating an agrarian utopia, it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era, resulting in the deaths of at least 1.7 million Cambodians -- about a quarter of the country's population -- over the next four years. Ly remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings, three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years, before her father was shot to death before her eyes in 1979. His killing prompted Ly to leave her sole remaining family member, youngest sister Bo, in the care of a local couple. She set out on her own, making her way to a refugee camp and eventually to the United States. For more than 30 years she has wondered what happened to her baby sister. ""I think she was the only family member to survive,"" she says, with tears in her eyes. As she finishes her story, the producers usher a woman on the stage. It's Bo. Ly embraces her sister and both women sob. ""I missed you so much,"" Ly says. ""I've always searched for you,"" Bo tells her. Since production began five years ago, the television show, ""It's Not A Dream,"" has reunited members of 54 Cambodian families shattered by the genocide. More than 1,500 have sought its help. The series is just one example of the ways in which Cambodia's traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught, painful business of reckoning with their history. ""The scars of the Khmer Rouge are very deep and physical and present in modern Cambodia,"" said Theary Seng, a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime, and who moved to the U.S. as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult. She described the country as a ""land of orphans."" For decades after the Khmer Rouge were driven from Phnom Penh by Soviet-backed Vietnamese forces in January 1979, the regime's crimes were seldom spoken about, let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims. In large part, this was because people remained scared, say experts. Far from being snuffed out by the Vietnamese invasion, the Khmer Rouge existed for another two decades. After fleeing the capital in 1979, Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and his supporters established a stronghold in the west. They continued as an insurgent guerrilla force and became part of a government-in-exile that, until 1990, was recognized by the U.N. as the country's only legitimate representative. ""In many villages, people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades,"" said Krisna Uk, executive director of the Center for Khmer Studies. Craig Etcheson, a Cambodia expert at the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University, said that ""for many years, there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the Khmer Rouge, as if the very words were ... a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room."" The silence was also due to the fact that Cambodians, in Seng's words, ""lacked the vocabulary"" of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society. The Khmer Rouge's attempts to reboot society at ""Year Zero"" had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the country's educated classes -- doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers, merchants and clergy. ""Nearly two generations of young Cambodian men grew up learning little more than how to kill,"" said Etcheson. ""When it was finally time to rebuild, there were effectively no bootstraps with which the country could pull itself up again."" Even today, said Uk, young Cambodians are not taught about the genocide in high school. In an impoverished country -- one of Asia's poorest, albeit with 7% predicted economic growth this year -- most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back, she said. Some were even skeptical that the Khmer Rouge's crimes -- the systematic butchery of the ""killing fields"" -- had really occurred, she added. The space for discussing, redressing and healing from the genocide only began to open up in the past decade with the establishment of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, said Seng. Founded in 2006, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) is a ""hybrid"" tribunal using both Cambodian and international judges and staff to investigate the Khmer Rouge's crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice. Intended as a southeast Asian equivalent of the Nuremberg trials, the tribunal, which has cost $232 million so far, initially enjoyed broad support. ""We had great hope for this process,"" said Seng. ""The presence of the international community raised the comfort level of the population to speak about the Khmer Rouge crimes."" But the pace of proceedings has seemed glacial, given the advancing years of the suspected war criminals, two of whom have died while facing trial. Another was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial. (The Khmer Rouge's top leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998, having never faced charges.) This, coupled with persistent accusations of political interference from the Cambodian government, has soured attitudes towards the court. Seng, who once appeared as a civil party in proceedings, today regards it as a ""sham."" For many victims, it is ""too little, too late."" OPINION: An ongoing struggle for justice after the Khmer Rouge. In the first case heard, Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Comrade Duch -- commandant of the notorious Tuol Sleng prison where more than 14,000 people were killed -- received a life sentence for war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture. The court's only other verdicts, delivered in August last year, sentenced Non Chea, the regime's ""Brother Number Two,"" and Khieu Samphan, ""Brother Number Four,"" to life. Both men have appealed their convictions. In a separate case, the pair are on trial on additional charges of crimes against humanity and genocide. Evidence is expected to continue being heard into 2016, ECCC spokesman Lars Olsen said. Two further, and highly controversial cases, known as 003 and 004, are also currently under investigation. Three people were charged last month in relation to those cases: former Khmer Rouge navy commander Meas Muth; Im Chaem, a former district commander accused of leading a labor camp; and Ao An, a former deputy accused of overseeing massacres at detention centers. Two other suspects are being investigated. Olsen said no further cases would be pursued after 003 and 004. Prime Minister Hun Sen, Cambodia's strongman leader for decades, has long been a vocal opponent of 003 and 004, claiming that pursuing the cases could push the country towards civil war. Hun Sen himself is a former Khmer Rouge battalion commander, who defected to the Vietnamese side; his perceived political interference is viewed by critics like Seng as an attempt to shield political allies from the tribunal. Others are more forgiving of the tribunal's shortcomings. Etcheson, a former investigator for the tribunal, has described it as an ""imperfect vessel"" for delivering justice, but says Cambodia's leaders must strike a balance between two imperatives: delivering justice for victims, and completing the reintegration of former Khmer Rouge into society. He said the most important aspects of the tribunal's work are those that take place outside the courtroom -- triggering changes in Cambodian society. ""In that respect, the proceedings ... may be shaping up to be more successful than anyone could have hoped,"" he added. Undoubtedly, Cambodians today have overcome the fear of talking about the genocide -- to the extent that even the perpetrators feel emboldened to say their piece. Krisna Uk said the country has seen a wave of Khmer Rouge memoirs, written by former cadres wanting to argue their case before they die. ""There's a lot of people who want to tell the world they've been fooled by a grand idea of a revolution which went bad,"" she said. Khieu Samphan, ""Brother Number Four,"" published one such effort ahead of his trial, while Sikoeun Suong, a Sorbonne-educated former diplomat for the Khmer Rouge regime, published his ""Journey of a Khmer Rouge Intellectual"" in French in 2013. He told an interviewer from France's Le Monde last year that he believed that Khmer Rouge dictator Pol Pot's prescriptions for Cambodia were sound. ""I remain convinced that the Marxist analysis made by Pol Pot of the socioeconomic situation of Cambodia, a poor and sparsely populated country, was correct,"" he said. For survivors, these self-serving justifications for crimes gone unpunished must be hard to take. But for a few of them, at least, Cambodia's opening up about the genocide has finally brought about the prospect of some healing, however bittersweet. On the stage of the ""It's Not a Dream"" studio, as Ly hugs her long-lost sister, footage of an even older woman is projected on a screen. ""Do you know the person in the video?"" the show's host asks. ""Yes,"" Ly says. ""She is my mother."" Moments later, Te Souymoy, 77, is brought up on stage. ""Where have you two been?"" Te asks. ""I always worried about you two."" ""I thought you died,"" Ly says. The three women cry and embrace. ""It is very miserable for all of us,"" the old woman says.

""He lapsed into a coma, died, was resuscitated, stayed in a coma and on Monday, underwent extensive surgery at Shock Trauma to save his life. He clung to life for seven days and died today at approximately 7 a.m.  We believe the police are keeping the circumstances of Freddie's death secret until they develop a version of events that will absolve them of all responsibility,"" said Murphy. The attorney added that Gray's spinal cord was severely injured. At this point, police are declining to say much about the case, citing ongoing administrative and criminal investigations.

The Baltimore Ravens appear to be se tot make a big move ahead of the NFL Trade deadline on Tuesday, with the running game the target.
With the Tennessee Titans seemingly embracing a much needed rebuild, kicked off by the decision to start Will Levis as Ryan Tannehill is injured and the trading of long-time safety and team captain Kevin Byard, it appears that the Titans may be sellers at the deadline.
A number of NFL journalists, sports content creators, and analysts have already been speculating that the Titans may be very busy at the deadline, but now it appears that one of their biggest names will likely be changing jerseys next week.
That player is Titans running back Derrick Henry, who has long been one of the best running backs in the league, despite having a down season in 2023, compared to his production in prior seasons.
Henry had been rumored to be available during the offseason, so trading him next week wouldn't come as a complete shock, and it appears that two teams are considered to be leading the pack when it comes to landing Henry.
The Baltimore Ravens and Cleveland Browns already have a storied rivalry, and they appear set to battle it out for Henry in the coming days.
However, it appears that the Ravens have the inside track.
Baltimore, which has a Top 5 rushing offense in the NFL, has had to rely on quarterback Lamar Jackson for the bulk of their rushing yards and rushing touchdowns, and without Jackson's contributions the Ravens would drop out of the Top 10 in rushing.
The Ravens are also without running back J.K. Dobbins who suffered a season-ending Achilles injury in the season opener, leaving the team to rely on the likes of Gus Edwards and Justive Hill, along with Melvin Gordon.
The leads to the Ravens having interest in Henry, and likely being the most aggressive in landing him.
Regardless of where he lands, it appears likely that Henry will be on the move next week.

Earlier this year, a New York Representative passed a bill to prevent schools from receiving aid if they house illegal immigrants. Now, Senator Ted Cruz is introducing a Senate version of the bill. It’s called “The Schools Not Shelters Act”.
Republican Representative Marc Molinaro of New York introduced the bill earlier this year. It passed along with the support of four Democrats.
Cruz wants to ensure schools don’t become shelters for illegal immigrants. According to the senator, taxpayer funds should not have to be the solution to support illegal immigrants at the expense of children attending school.
According to Fox 26, Senator Cruz said:
""Under Joe Biden, we have a wide-open southern border. The Biden Border Crisis has created the largest illegal immigration crisis in our nation's history. Biden's open borders are an invitation for cartels to brutalize children, assault women, overrun our communities with illegal aliens, and flood this country with narcotics and fentanyl. These drugs kill over 100,000 people per year.”
“This bill would stop the Biden Border Crisis dead in its tracks by building the wall, ratcheting up asylum standards, increasing the number of Border Patrol Agents, and implementing effective border security policies.""
In a statement, Cruz said according to Fox News:
""The invasion at our southern border is straining local services, overwhelming hospitals, and overcrowding schools. To make matters worse, leftist sanctuary cities are even using K-12 schools and college campuses as housing for illegal aliens.""
""Instead of addressing the learning loss caused by Democrat COVID lockdowns, sanctuary cities are focused on diverting resources from students to house illegal aliens. Students are losing access to gyms, dorms, and other school facilities in order to accommodate illegal aliens. Housing unvetted, potentially dangerous illegal aliens in schools is a recipe for disaster.""
Senator Cruz argues President Biden’s policies have not helped keep America’s borders safe.
Congressman Bob Good shares his thoughts on the bill.

When his fiancée takes the stand and testifies Hernandez told her to ditch a box from their basement the day after Lloyd's slaying, his eyes are glued on her. She barely glances his way but does appear to say something as she passes the defense table on the way out. When Kraft is asked to officially point out Hernandez in court and describe what he was wearing, I watch Hernandez look down at his shirt and tie as Kraft detailed his outfit. When the team owner leaves the stand -- the same man who signed him to a $40 million bonus in 2012 -- Hernandez turns and watches him walk out of the courtroom.

Moschetto faces several charges, including criminal solicitation, conspiracy, burglary, arson, criminal prescription sale, and weapons charges. Prosecutors allege that Moschetto sold weapons to undercover officers and discussed his plan to harm a rival cardiologist with an informant. Two other men, James Chmela and James Kalamaras, were also charged as accomplices. Moschetto has pleaded not guilty and been released on $2 million bond. His attorney plans to get him back to work, as he is concerned about his patients.

For decades, the missing person case involving Mary Ann Johnson has gone unsolved. According to reports, the 54-year-old may have run into trouble, but what kind remains a mystery. It’s said that just a few days before Christmas in 1994, the 54-year-old was threatened by men hired to break her legs.
Three men told Mary Ann they were paid $800 to harm her. However, they decided to pocket the money and instead warned her of the potential danger. Although they spared her, the men did not reveal who hired them for the would-be assault. They also didn’t tell Mary Ann why the unidentified person went to such lengths to hurt her.
On January 19, 1994, Mary Ann Johnson went to work at the Robinson’s May Department Store in Los Angeles, California, as an account representative. Mary Ann was last seen leaving her job after telling her co-workers that she was meeting up with her estranged husband, Andrew Johnson, the next day.
Andrew told police that he did, indeed, speak with his wife the day she vanished. Yet, he claimed they were not scheduled to meet the following day. He admitted they were reconciling, and while they were separated in 1993, neither party filed for divorce. The pair also owned a restaurant in Van Nuys, California, called Louisiana West. It went out of business prior to Mary Ann going missing.
On January 26, Mary Ann Johnson’s vehicle was located at the eatery’s parking lot. The restaurant was locked, and Mary Ann’s keys were found inside her car. It is unclear if any evidence was recovered from the vehicle or the establishment. Updates about this case are scarce, but Mary Ann is listed as an endangered missing person. It is unclear if the authorities have named a person of interest.
At the time of her disappearance, Mary Ann Johnson stood 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed 150 pounds. She had reddish brown hair, brown eyes, and her ears were pierced. What she was last seen wearing is unknown. Her X-Ray records are reportedly not on file. Mary Ann would be 83 years old at the time of this publication.
Anyone with information about this case is urged to contact the Los Angeles Police Department- Adult Missing Persons Unit at (877) 275-5273 or their local authorities. The agency case number is 941006395.
Please share this story about Mary Ann Johnson to help ignite interest in her missing person case. She is our sister and her life matters.

The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers tease that an engagement isn’t a happy event for everyone in Los Angeles.
Deacon (Sean Kanan) and Sheila (Kimberlin Brown) have carried on a relationship for months under the noses of everyone around them.
With the proposal he sprung on her last week, the two are moving toward marriage.
While they are excited about their future, not everyone is on board with their plans — especially their children.
As the news travels through the town, the reactions are not what they had hoped.
Here’s what’s happening this week on The Bold and the Beautiful.
Hope freaks out about Deacon and Sheila
The Bold and the Beautiful preview video shows a visibly distraught Hope (Annika Noelle) in Deacon’s apartment.
She can’t believe her father would allow Sheila into his life, let alone marry her.
Hope knows how dangerous this could be, so she is concerned.
When Sheila tries to interject, Hope shuts her down. She isn’t interested in hearing anything she says.
Ridge and Brooke find out about Deacon and Sheila
Hope runs to her mom and Ridge (Thorsten Kaye) to help talk Deacon out of marrying Sheila.
While Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) is shocked by the news, Ridge doesn’t bat an eye.
He has known for quite some time that Deacon and Sheila have been having a relationship. During the sting he and Bill (Don Diamont) operated to catch her up and put her in jail, they used Hope’s dad to lure her in and capture her.
When he admits it to the Logan women, expect there to be some disdain for his lack of honesty.
More The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers
As Eric (John McCook) continues to have health issues, Luna (Lisa Yamada) and RJ (Joshua Hoffman) grow closer.
The head of Forrester is determined to fight this alone, and Donna (Jennifer Gareis) isn’t privy to everything happening with her husband.
Finn (Tanner Novlan) isn’t happy about things with Sheila and Deacon either. After meeting with Deacon and having his biological mother sprung on him, things don’t go as the couple hoped.
Steffy (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) won’t return home until Sheila is handled, and Finn struggles with everything. He and Hope connected last week, so it wouldn’t be shocking if he turned to her. After all, it’s their parents getting married.
Be sure to tune in daily so that not a moment of the drama is missed.
The Bold and the Beautiful airs weekdays on CBS.

At first glance Trey Moses and Ellie Meredith couldn't be more different. But all that changed Thursday when Trey asked Ellie to be his prom date.

Trey made the prom-posal (yes, that's what they are calling invites to prom these days) in the gym during Ellie's P.E. class. Trina Helson, a teacher at Eastern, alerted the school's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of Trey and Ellie on Twitter that have gone viral. She wasn't surpristed by Trey's actions. ""That's the kind of person Trey is,"" she said. To help make sure she said yes, Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read ""Let's Party Like it's 1989,"" a reference to the latest album by Taylor Swift, Ellie's favorite singer. Trey also got the OK from Ellie's parents the night before via text. They were thrilled. ""You just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child,""  said Darla Meredith, Ellie's mom. ""You first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect."" Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school, but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her. She said Best Buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like Ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions. ""I guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought,"" she said, but ""this school, this year has been a relief."" Trey's future coach at Ball State, James Whitford, said he felt great about the prom-posal, noting that Trey, whom he's known for a long time, often works with other kids. Trey's mother, Shelly Moses, was also proud of her son. ""It's exciting to bring awareness to a good cause,"" she said. ""Trey has worked pretty hard, and he's a good son."" Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do. Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major, in addition to playing basketball in the fall. As for Ellie, she can't stop thinking about prom. ""Ellie can't wait to go dress shopping"" her mother said. ""Because I've only told about a million people!"" Ellie interjected.

To help make sure she said yes, Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read ""Let\'s Party Like it\'s 1989,"" a reference to the latest album by Taylor Swift, Ellie\'s favorite singer. Trey also got the OK from Ellie\'s parents the night before via text. They were thrilled. ""You just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child,""  said Darla Meredith, Ellie\'s mom. ""You first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect."" Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school, but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her. She said Best Buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like Ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions. ""I guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought,"" she said, but ""this school, this year has been a relief."" Trey\'s future coach at Ball State, James Whitford, said he felt great about the prom-posal, noting that Trey, whom he\'s known for a long time, often works with other kids. Trey\'s mother, Shelly Moses, was also proud of her son. ""It\'s exciting to bring awareness to a good cause,"" she said. ""Trey has worked pretty hard, and he\'s a good son."" Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do. Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major, in addition to playing basketball in the fall. As for Ellie, she can\'t stop thinking about prom. ""Ellie can\'t wait to go dress shopping"" her mother said. ""Because I\'ve only told about a million people!"" Ellie interjected.\n\noutput:'}

The future of 1000-Lb. Sisters has remained uncertain for months following a brawl between Amy and Tammy Slaton.
As Monsters and Critics previously reported, the Slaton sisters were involved in a physical scuffle that halted production for Season 5.
TLC’s camera crews ceased filming after Tammy and Amy got into it with Amanda Halterman and Chris Combs during a family vacation to Florida.
The Slaton family’s behavior caused production to feel “uncomfortable working with them,” but it looks as though they’ve since reconciled.
As The Sun reports, Tammy and her family have reportedly signed contracts to continue filming Season 5.
A source told the outlet that the Slatons began filming last weekend and that Season 5 will air as a two-part segment, similar to Season 4.
In August 2023, Tammy told her fans that a second installment of Season 4 is slated for the fall.
“My wedding was a two-part thing, so it made Season 4 have more episodes, so we have Part B coming out December 12,” Tammy said in a since-deleted TikTok.
Sources say 1000-Lb. Sisters will be renewed for Season 6
The Sun’s insider claimed that with each new season of 1000-Lb. Sisters, the cast receives a pay raise, which is great news for the Slatons.
While Tammy and Amy film Season 5, they have another pay raise to look forward to in the future because the same insider told The Sun that “TLC is looking ahead to a sixth season, but nothing is official yet.”
Earlier this year, it was reported that the Slaton family was clashing with producers about their salaries and contracts. Tammy reportedly earns around $2 to 3 thousand per episode, while Amy rakes in just $700 per month.
There was even some chatter online that Tammy was pursuing an alternate career path in plus-size modeling to pay the bills while she waited for news about the future of 1000-Lb. Sisters.
Tammy reportedly accused 1000-Lb. Sisters producers of ‘forcing’ drama during Season 4B
In addition to qualms about her financial stability on the show, Tammy had reportedly expressed her annoyance with producers for “forcing drama” for the show.
When Amy and Tammy attended Tammy’s late husband Caleb Willingham’s funeral over the summer, producers allegedly pushed to “make it seem sad when it really wasn’t that sad.”
A source claimed that Amy and Tammy were in talks with another production company in the hopes of filming a spinoff. But with the news that Season 5 has been greenlit, it appears the Slaton sisters have finally come to a suitable agreement.
1000-Lb. Sisters is currently on hiatus on TLC.

The US Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon has recommended that all US citizens in the country leave now, while commercial flights are available, due to the unpredictable security situation related to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. In the same announcement, the US Embassy stated that US citizens should have a plan in place for crisis situations that does not rely on assistance from the US government, as US military-assisted evacuations from other countries is rare.
The announcement also mentions that the best time to leave a country is before the crisis occurs. As to what crisis this might be refering to, speculation would say the possibility of Hezbollah joining in the war against Israel. Already there have been ongoing skirmishes of attrition along the Lebanese-Israeli de-facto boundary, which has seen Hezbollah launching rockets against Israeli military positions and settlements while Israel has launched its own missiles and armed drones against Hezbollah fighters. The violence has only increased as Hezbollah has threatened to support Hamas if Israel goes forward with the ground offensive in Gaza.
While Lebanon cannot afford to get involved in the war between Israel and Hamas, given the dire financial hardships plaguing the entire country, the fact of the matter is that Hezbollah might drag them into the war anyway. Indeed, according to a statement by Hezbollah's leadership, they have been having discussions with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad for what they must do to achieve an ""all-out victory"" over Israel in this latest conflict.
Given that the recommendation to leave the country is coming now so soon on the heels of Israel declaring its intentions to expand operations on the ground in Gaza, the concern likely is that Hezbollah might be about to increase its own involvement in the war as well. Whether that leads to the war expanding to include Lebanon, and what Syria and Iran might do as well, remains to be seen.

Mystery Deepens as 14-Year-Old's Disappearance Remains Unexplained by Father in 2012.
Brittany Shante Robinson, a 14-year-old from Mobile, Alabama, was known for her affinity for reading and sketching. Excelling academically, she was placed in advanced classes and had built a positive rapport with her educators. Brittany lived with her mother, Tiana Hogue, while shared custody was maintained with her father, Demetric Lemond Hooper.
On June 14, 2012, Brittany was picked up by Demetric’s sister, Sierra Hooper, for a brief stay with her father, with a planned return on June 18th. To Tiana's alarm, that return never took place.
Initially, Tiana gave the benefit of the doubt, suspecting the trip might have been extended for a couple of days. But, as time stretched and neither Brittany nor Demetric reached out, her worry intensified. A short text from Demetric on June 20th promised Brittany’s return in an hour, but she never arrived. A later message from him claimed they were at a wedding and Brittany would be home soon.
However, Demetric's subsequent silence and the barren state of his apartment – as if it had been swiftly vacated – raised alarms. In the absence of any sign of Brittany and with Demetric's evasiveness, Tiana's concerns escalated.
Subsequent events led to a custodial interference warrant being issued for Demetric on July 26th. His whereabouts remained a puzzle until a tip led police to locate him in Arkansas at a research center. Oddly, he was participating in a trial for schizophrenia medication. Among his possessions were Brittany’s pink iPod and a puzzling rope.
Though Demetric received a 10-year sentence, he was released in 2016, continuing to ambiguously assert Brittany's safety but offering no concrete details of her location.
Brittany was last seen donning a pink floral blouse and blue denim. She suffers from asthma and was without her essential medicine during her visit. Any leads or pertinent details should be relayed to MPD at 251-208-1700.

Growing crowds of migrants are creating problems for authorities at the U.S.-Mexico border between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. The situation came to a head Tuesday night when hundreds of migrants rushed Mexican authorities who were attempting to hold a large number of them from crossing over into neighboring El Paso. The Univision station in El Paso captured video of the chaos that ensued:
According to the El Paso Times, a large number of migrants - mostly Venezuelans - managed to get past the Mexican authorities and reach the razor wire on the Texas side of the border.
The State of Texas has been reinforcing El Paso with barbed wire and troops for months as part of its ""Operation Lone Star"" border security efforts. However, reports of Border Patrol Agents cutting that wire to allow migrants to pass have stirred up a hornet's nest of criticism.
As I explained on NewsBreak three days ago, the actual border is the middle of the Rio Grande - so once migrants reach the razor wire they are already in the U.S. The Border Patrol has a duty to take custody of them at that point - so the migrants that reached the wire in El Paso will likely be allowed to pass. Most are expected to request asylum .
The crisis at the border between the twin cities of El Paso and Ciudad Juarez didn't end with the incident Tuesday night. The El Paso Times describes a tense situation continuing on the Juarez side with Mexican authorities holding back a large crowd of migrants still intent on crossing over into Texas.
El Paso Matters, which has posted a photo of that standoff on x.com/(Twitter) says most of the migrants are arriving by train and intend to head directly to the border based on rumors they are allowed to cross:
The Telemundo television station in El Paso showed video of freight trains arriving in Ciudad Juarez carrying hundreds of migrants - so the crowds at the border could continue to grow:
El Paso ABC affiliate KVIA estimated the arrivals by train in Juares by ""the thousands.""

Stuffed animals remain in one room. On the wall in another hangs a poster on proper preparation for Muslim prayer. These small reminders of college life at this Kenyan school belie the horror of what happened here: the slaughter of at least 147 people, many of them students who lived in this building. On Friday afternoon, more than 36 hours after the attack, investigators and Kenya Red Cross crews were finishing up the task of removing the bodies of dead students. The corpses of four Al-Shabaab attackers -- dressed head to toe in black and still clutching their AK-47s -- remained where they fell, their bodies shattered in a torrent of bullets. Kenya terrorist attack: 6 things you need to know. Investigators marked the locations of students' bodies with numbered tags before Red Cross workers came in to send them off to morgues. They would call out to each other with the locations of the dead, reducing once promising lives, for the time being at least, to numbers. 221. 214. 216. 217.

Shattered glass and shell casings littered the floor. Walls and ceilings were marred by bullet holes. In some places, the blood was as thick as mud. The problems plaguing Kenya's security efforts. According to students and authorities, militants burst onto the campus around 5 a.m. Thursday. The gunmen, from the Al-Shabaab terror group, first stormed a Christian prayer service, killing some students, taking others hostage. They rampaged across the campus, shooting non-Muslims, sparing Muslims, a witness said. One student, Hellen Titus, told CNN she hid inside a wardrobe for nearly an hour before the gunmen came for her. Come out, they told her, you won't be shot. ""They were lying,"" she said. The gunmen herded her and maybe three dozen other students into a community room where they'd usually hang out and watch television. They were told to lie down, lectured about how the Quran forbids killing women. And then the men, Titus said, were shot in the head. One of the gunmen egged on the others. ""Shoot them! Shoot them!"" he would say, according to Titus. More lecturing: the land, the gunmen said, didn't belong to nonbelievers. We, the gunmen said, have just two missions: to kill, and be killed. And then they started shooting the women. ""Anyone who is breathing, shoot them,"" Titus said the gunman in charge said. ""We just lay there hopelessly, because we know automatically we're going to be killed,"" Titus said. It was then she saw the blood of a fellow student coursing toward her on the floor. She smeared it onto her face and body to make it appear she, too, was dead. ""In the time of shooting, they skipped me,"" she said. She survived with only a hand wound. Many of the other students were shot in the back of the head, a medic told CNN. Others had been beheaded, according to people who had viewed bodies at the morgue in Chiromo.

2545,3115,Summarize the following news within 175 words:,"The Arizona police officer who intentionally slammed his car into an armed suspect previously faced an excessive force lawsuit in New York, according to court documents. Officer Michael Rapiejko was with the New York Police Department from 2003 to 2006. Two years after he left, he was one of the defendants in a suit filed by a man who alleged that Rapiejko pointed a gun and threatened to shoot him and handcuffed and choked him in front of his family during a 2005 arrest. The lawsuit said Luis Colon had parked his car and gotten out when Rapiejko, with his gun aimed at Colon, ordered him back into the car. During his arrest on charges of obstructing governmental administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, Colon alleged he was yanked from the car, handcuffed and choked. The charges against Colon were dropped six months later. Colon also sued two unnamed officers who arrived after the initial confrontation, court documents show. Colon and the city settled the suit for $20,000. The settlement said the defendants were not admitting to any wrongdoing. Rapiejko had resigned voluntarily in 2006, and there is no indication of any disciplinary action against him from the NYPD, a senior law enforcement official told CNN. The NYPD has said that it will not release further details about Rapiejko. Rapiejko's actions in Marana, Arizona, in which he drove his patrol car into a man who had fired a rifle in the air minutes earlier and before that had pointed the gun at another officer, have stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer for the February incident. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's ""New Day"" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. ""That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,"" Rozema said. ""So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,"" the chief added. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a nearby Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Rapiejko's camera shows the officer's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. ""We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,"" Rozema said. ""And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' "" Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN on Tuesday that ""it is miraculous that my client isn't dead."" ""Everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force,"" Cohen-Metzger said. Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told CNN that Valencia was involved in several crimes there the day he was struck, including a stealing a car that he drove a half hour north to Marana. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Cohen-Metzger said he had a prior record. His next court appearance is May 18. He is in the Pima County Jail. Marana police on Thursday told CNN's Miguel Marquez that a store gun lock was still on the rifle when it was recovered. The wire that goes through the trigger and the lever to reload the gun were loose enough to allow it to still be used, police said. CNN's Tony Marco, Jason Hanna and Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley contributed to this report.

Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results ""do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying."" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U.S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. ""We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries,"" Enck said. ""You definitely want to wash them really good. ""This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant,"" Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. ""It's not something that you would have any warning of,"" Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. On Monday, it ended its contract with Terminix. In an email to CNN before the termination, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is ""committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment"" and is ""looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities."" The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation. ""Many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured, distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family's injuries,"" Maron said. The attorney added: ""The family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable."" CNN's Rob Frehse, Jean Casarez, Sara Ganim, Jason Hanna, Laura Ly and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.

385,511,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"I don't always talk about news events with my daughters, but there was something about the story of ESPN reporter Britt McHenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up. One of the main things I preach to my girls, ages 7 and 9, is the importance of respecting other people, no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish. It's something that my husband and I just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the President of the United States. Let me say right here that I have lost my cool from time to time, whether it's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant. In those cases, when I feel like I'm going to pop, I keep saying, ""This is unacceptable, This is unacceptable,"" and either hang up in disgust or storm off. (Not perfect ways of handling these incidents, but at no time would I ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations.) Some of McHenry's comments, such as how she's ""on television,"" imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she, by dint of her career, education and income, is better than people who don't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities. McHenry showed that she either forgot those ""golden rule"" lessons from childhood or that she hasn't really lived her life with that mantra. McHenry has since apologized on Twitter, saying she said ""some insulting and regrettable things,"" and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in Virginia,  she should ""always choose to be respectful and take the high road."" But it's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker. ""I see this Britt McHenry video, and think: it's not just about how a celebrity shouldn't act in public, it's how all of us shouldn't act,"" wrote ""Cait"" on Twitter. Said ""Shannon,"" also on Twittter, ""I had no idea who Britt McHenry was before but ... now I know she's the kind of woman I hope I've taught my daughters not to be."" ""Her language and disdain brings shame on her, her profession, and her employer. People don't all of sudden have such a vile tirade. This comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors. Let's let her be an example to others,"" wrote C Cooper on a Change.org petition asking McHenry's employers to fire her. The McHenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her. This morning, I told her McHenry was suspended for a week by ESPN, and that led to another conversation. My kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to ""treat other people the way you would want them to treat you"" even in uncomfortable moments. Celebrity apologies: The good, bad and uncomfortable. So, Britt McHenry, check out these examples of how the rich, famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity. After British journalist Katie Hopkins seriously fat-shamed pop music star Kelly Clarkson, saying a host of insulting things about the singer's weight, Clarkson won praise for her graceful response. ""That's because she doesn't know me. I'm awesome. It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will. I've just never cared what people think,"" she said. A college baseball player gets suspended for calling Little League baseball phenom Mo'ne Davis a ""slut."" Her response? She emailed Bloomsburg University asking that the college reinstate him. ""Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance,"" Davis, the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in Little League World Series history, told ESPN. ""... I know right now he's really hurt and I know how hard he worked to get where he is. I mean, I was pretty hurt on my part but I know he's hurting even more."" When an Argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to Pope Francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country's president ahead of the general election in October and possibly influencing the outcome, what did the Pope do? Well, he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call. Wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation! The pope appears to have been more than graceful, because after the conversation, the journalist pledged to learn how to pray. When Queen Bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lip-synching the national anthem in honor of President Obama's inauguration in 2013, she didn't come out swinging. Instead, she admitted to singing along with her ""pre-recorded track"" at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring, a cappella rendition of the national anthem. Finally, Reese Witherspoon may be the closest example for McHenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode. When Witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence, the Academy Award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as, ""Do you know who I am?"" and ""You're about to find out who I am."" She ultimately issued an apologetic statement, and then went on morning television to apologize some more. ""We went out to dinner in Atlanta, and we had one too many glasses of wine, and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not,"" she said on ""Good Morning America."" ""It's completely unacceptable, and we are so sorry and embarrassed. We know better, and we shouldn't have done that."" And, she added, ""When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car. I learned that for sure,"" she told the GMA host . Now, did McHenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry, you never berate them for their weight, job, appearance and income? Let's hope so. Can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect? Share your thoughts with Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.

1061,1373,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"Garissa, Kenya (CNN)Kenyan police have arrested five suspects in connection with Thursday's attack at Garissa University College, Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said Friday, according to CNN affiliate NTV. Nkaissery told reporters the university will be able to confirm Saturday if everyone has been accounted for. Thursday's attack by al-Shabaab militants killed 147 people, including 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel. The attack left 104 people injured, including 19 who are in critical condition, Nkaissery said. During search and recovery efforts on Friday, CNN witnessed one male who was not a student hiding under a bed. That male was taken into custody and was being treated as a suspect, sources close to the search told CNN. The find sparked an additional search of the building. Sources said three people, all students, were found alive. A female student was found under a pile of bodies, another female student was hiding in a wardrobe and a male student was hiding in the bathroom, the sources confirmed to CNN. Student Hellen Titus said she survived by fooling the attackers into thinking she was dead. After gunmen shot fellow students, she smeared their blood onto her body to make it seem she'd been shot, too, she told CNN on Friday at a makeshift center for evacuated students. ""In the time of shooting,"" she said, ""they skipped me."" Most of the victims had been shot from behind, in the back of the head, a medic told CNN. ""They're facing down, always,"" a worker with St. John's ambulance service said Friday. ""They're always facing down, and they're shot in the heads, around the back."" Al-Shabaab's long, bloody legacy with Kenya. Early Thursday, an explosion and gunfire cut through the morning quiet on the campus about 90 miles (145 kilometers) from Kenya's border with Somalia, tearing many students in dormitories out of their sleep. ""Never heard anything like this,"" journalist  Dennis Okari from CNN affiliate NTV tweeted as he watched smoke rising over a student hostel. Al-Shabaab gunmen had first stormed a Christian prayer service, where they killed some and took others hostage. Then they went across campus with them, shooting non-Muslims and sparing Muslims, a witness said. They headed for the hostels. Student Japhet Mwala lay in her bed. ""We were sleeping when we heard a loud explosion that was followed by gunshots, and everyone started running for safety,"" she told Agence France-Presse. Awaking to terror: 'I am lucky to be alive' ""There are those who were not able to leave the hostels where the gunmen headed and started firing. I am lucky to be alive because I jumped through the fence with other students,"" she said. Students ran -- some crawled -- away from the gunfire, Okari said. At one point, the gunmen pinned down a building where 360 students lived, Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said. Okari took cover outside the campus and listened to explosions and gunfire for four hours. Kenyan security forces moved in and killed four gunmen. Somali terror group Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack. The Interior Ministry has posted a ""most wanted"" notice for a man in connection with it. It offered a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, about $215,000, for Mohamed Mohamud, who goes by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere. The post does not say what role the man may have played. Kenyan police are circulating ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" posters featuring eight terror suspects who are wanted in separate attacks in Kenya, the Interior Ministry said. Police are offering a bounty of more than $210,000 for the suspects, the Ministry said via Twitter. The dangerously porous border between Somalia and Kenya has made it easy for Al-Shabaab militants to cross over and carry out attacks. In a December attack at a quarry, Al-Shabaab militants separated Muslims from others and executed the non-Muslims, killing at least 36 people. In November, militants stopped a bus near the border and killed 28 people they believed to be non-Muslims. Last month, the U.S. Embassy warned of possible attacks ""throughout Kenya in the near-term"" after the reported death of a key Al-Shabaab leader, Adan Garaar, who was suspected in the September 2013 Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi. Opinion: A weakened Al-Shabaab lashes out. Police have declared a curfew for the next several days in the region from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. The Education Ministry has closed the university indefinitely. Surviving students have gathered in large groups at the town's airport, waiting to be flown to their hometowns. The effects are also being felt 225 miles west in Kenya's capital of Nairobi, where the new bloodshed reinvigorated an old debate: Is the nation's security strong enough? Many thought measures taken after the Westgate Mall massacre had filled the gaps. At least 67 people died then. But Thursday's attack is the second-worst in the country's history, and it has evaporated much of the confidence won after Westgate. Civil liberty concerns had held up the enrollment of 10,000 new police recruits, but on Thursday, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta gave a directive to process them. ""Kenya badly needs additional officers,"" he said, ""and I will not keep the nation waiting."" The problems plaguing Kenya's security efforts. CNN's Christian Purefoy reported from Garissa, and CNN's Ben Brumfield wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Brian Walker, Vasco Cotovio and Lillian Leposo also contributed to this report.

{'question': 'Summarize the following news within 200 words:', 'passages': 'Garissa, Kenya (CNN)Kenyan police have arrested five suspects in connection with Thursday\'s attack at Garissa University College, Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said Friday, according to CNN affiliate NTV. Nkaissery told reporters the university will be able to confirm Saturday if everyone has been accounted for. Thursday\'s attack by al-Shabaab militants killed 147 people, including 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel. The attack left 104 people injured, including 19 who are in critical condition, Nkaissery said. During search and recovery efforts on Friday, CNN witnessed one male who was not a student hiding under a bed. That male was taken into custody and was being treated as a suspect, sources close to the search told CNN. The find sparked an additional search of the building. Sources said three people, all students, were found alive. A female student was found under a pile of bodies, another female student was hiding in a wardrobe and a male student was hiding in the bathroom, the sources confirmed to CNN. Student Hellen Titus said she survived by fooling the attackers into thinking she was dead. After gunmen shot fellow students, she smeared their blood onto her body to make it seem she\'d been shot, too, she told CNN on Friday at a makeshift center for evacuated students. ""In the time of shooting,"" she said, ""they skipped me."" Most of the victims had been shot from behind, in the back of the head, a medic told CNN. ""They\'re facing down, always,"" a worker with St. John\'s ambulance service said Friday. ""They\'re always facing down, and they\'re shot in the heads, around the back."" Al-Shabaab\'s long, bloody legacy with Kenya. Early Thursday, an explosion and gunfire cut through the morning quiet on the campus about 90 miles (145 kilometers) from Kenya\'s border with Somalia, tearing many students in dormitories out of their sleep. ""Never heard anything like this,"" journalist  Dennis Okari from CNN affiliate NTV tweeted as he watched smoke rising over a student hostel. Al-Shabaab gunmen had first stormed a Christian prayer service, where they killed some and took others hostage. Then they went across campus with them, shooting non-Muslims and sparing Muslims, a witness said. They headed for the hostels. Student Japhet Mwala lay in her bed. ""We were sleeping when we heard a loud explosion that was followed by gunshots, and everyone started running for safety,"" she told Agence France-Presse. Awaking to terror: \'I am lucky to be alive\' ""There are those who were not able to leave the hostels where the gunmen headed and started firing. I am lucky to be alive because I jumped through the fence with other students,"" she said. Students ran -- some crawled -- away from the gunfire, Okari said. At one point, the gunmen pinned down a building where 360 students lived, Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said. Okari took cover outside the campus and listened to explosions and gunfire for four hours. Kenyan security forces moved in and killed four gunmen. Somali terror group Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack. The Interior Ministry has posted a ""most wanted"" notice for a man in connection with it. It offered a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, about $215,000, for Mohamed Mohamud, who goes by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere. The post does not say what role the man may have played. Kenyan police are circulating ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" posters featuring eight terror suspects who are wanted in separate attacks in Kenya, the Interior Ministry said. Police are offering a bounty of more than $210,000 for the suspects, the Ministry said via Twitter. The dangerously porous border between Somalia and Kenya has made it easy for Al-Shabaab militants to cross over and carry out attacks. In a December attack at a quarry, Al-Shabaab militants separated Muslims from others and executed the non-Muslims, killing at least 36 people. In November, militants stopped a bus near the border and killed 28 people they believed to be non-Muslims. Last month, the U.S. Embassy warned of possible attacks ""throughout Kenya in the near-term"" after the reported death of a key Al-Shabaab leader, Adan Garaar, who was suspected in the September 2013 Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi. Opinion: A weakened Al-Shabaab lashes out. Police have declared a curfew for the next several days in the region from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. The Education Ministry has closed the university indefinitely. Surviving students have gathered in large groups at the town\'s airport, waiting to be flown to their hometowns. The effects are also being felt 225 miles west in Kenya\'s capital of Nairobi, where the new bloodshed reinvigorated an old debate: Is the nation\'s security strong enough? Many thought measures taken after the Westgate Mall massacre had filled the gaps. At least 67 people died then. But Thursday\'s attack is the second-worst in the country\'s history, and it has evaporated much of the confidence won after Westgate. Civil liberty concerns had held up the enrollment of 10,000 new police recruits, but on Thursday, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta gave a directive to process them. ""Kenya badly needs additional officers,"" he said, ""and I will not keep the nation waiting."" The problems plaguing Kenya\'s security efforts. CNN\'s Christian Purefoy reported from Garissa, and CNN\'s Ben Brumfield wrote from Atlanta. CNN\'s Brian Walker, Vasco Cotovio and Lillian Leposo also contributed to this report.\n\noutput:'}

Residents in this remote village, about a 44km drive from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, stand on the distinctive steeply terraced hillsides and wave furiously as the relief flight passes overhead. The mission, a joint effort between Indian air crew and a Nepalese army medical team, is only the third operation of its kind to reach the village since Saturday's massive 7.8-magnitude quake, which left more than 5,000 people dead. The aircraft is stuffed to capacity with tents, medicines and packages of tinned tuna, instant noodles and rice, all bundled haphazardly aboard the Mi-17 by soldiers at the air base in Kathmandu barely 15 minutes earlier.

He says people have been desperately awaiting the supplies. The situation in Melamchi and the surrounding villages is ""dire,"" he tells CNN through a translator. According to Nepal's National Emergency Operation Center, 1,376 people were killed in Sindhupalchok District, where Melamchi is located, when the earthquake hit. Some 18,000 houses were destroyed and 100,000 people have been displaced in the surrounding area, says Tamang. ""Everyone is sleeping outside,"" he says. He has serious concerns about food supplies in the region, saying the piled boxes of rice and noodles aren't nearly enough to meet the needs of local people. ""Aid agencies need to do something very quickly,"" he says. In the days since the quake, injured people from the region have been told to find their way to Melamchi so they can be picked up by the relief flights, he says.

Violations found in rental background checks, credit freezes
Oneof America's three major credit bureaus is facing a $23 million fine for its failures with both rental background checks and credit freeze products.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are taking action against TransUnion for activities the regulators say broke the law and harmed consumers.
In two separate investigations, federal regulators found that TransUnion failed to provide accurate information in rental background checks and failed to properly assist renters seeking to correct inaccurate information.
They also found that TransUnion lied to consumers about security freezes on credit reports, telling them their credit was frozen when in reality, it was placed in a backlog that in some cases took years to complete. All the while, consumer credit information was exposed.
“Americans across the country were put at risk of wrongful housing denials because TransUnion failed to follow the law,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “We are ordering TransUnion to cease its yearslong illegal activity, clean up its broken business practices, redress its victims, and pay penalties.”
As a result of the enforcement action against TransUnion on rental background checks, consumers will receive $11 million in payments (refunds for paying for the background checks and additional compensation that may be owed).
“Consumers struggling to find housing shouldn’t be shut out by tenant screening reports that are ridden with errors and based on data from secret sources,” said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Protecting consumers looking for housing is critical to a fair economy, and we are proud to partner with the CFPB in obtaining this record-breaking order.”
A recent analysis of tenant screening by the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) found that the reports often contain inaccuracies that can be difficult to correct. The TransUnion case lends additional credence to this claim.
“Tenant screening scores and recommendations create a misleading veneer of objectivity while concealing underlying racial disparities,” said Ariel Nelson, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. “Landlords frequently make leasing decisions based solely on these tenant screening scores and recommendations, and our research reveals that they are unlikely to hear disputes or to consider mitigating factors.”
Credit freeze backlog
In addition to the violations related to rental background checks, the investigation found that TransUnion had a years long backlog of credit freezes that were unfulfilled.
Specifically, some 40,000 requests for security freezes went unfulfilled.
As a result of this violation, TransUnion will pay $3 million to harmed consumers.
Consumer groups have consistently called for reform of the credit reporting industry.

One of the fugitives on the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted is wanted on multiple charges in Texas, per officials from the department.
According to the FBI, on May 11, 2012, a couple from Texas exchanged marriage vows and celebrated with a reception shortly after. Less than 48 hours later, per officials, the 26-year-old bride, Estrella Carrera, was tragically discovered in her apartment's bathtub, still in her wedding attire, having succumbed to fatal stab wounds.
The FBI has formally accused her newlywed, now 41-year-old Arnaldo Jiminez, of being responsible for this terrible crime. According to investigators, Jiminez allegedly stabbed Estrella while they were in his black four-door Maserati, and then he moved her lifeless body to the bathtub in her Burbank, Illinois apartment.
The FBI's pursuit of evidence in this case began with their focus on Jiminez's movements. Officials stated that they discovered that on May 12, his cellphone signal was traced to various locations, spanning from Chicago to Southern Illinois, Memphis, Tennessee, and finally culminating in Arkansas, all within a single day. The following day, his cell phone was registered in Houston, Texas, and eventually traced to Hidalgo, Mexico, according to investigators.
During the same year, law enforcement arrested Jiminez's brother on drug-related charges, which led to the discovery of Arnaldo's Maserati stored in the garage, according to a statement from the FBI. Traces of blood were found inside the vehicle, further supporting the theory that Jiminez may have committed the crime in the car before moving the body to the bathtub, per FBI officials.
Investigators stated they suspect that Jiminez's brother might have driven him to Mexico in the same vehicle and left him there. Since the night of the wedding, Jiminez has managed to elude authorities and remains unaccounted for. FBI officials believe he is likely in hiding in Mexico, specifically in the Santiago Papasquiaro area or in Reynosa, Tamaulipas.
A $250,000 reward is being offered for information leading to Jimenez's arrest, per officials.
FBI officials also stated that Jimenez should be considered armed and dangerous. If you have any information concerning this person, please call 1-800-CALL-FBI or contact your nearest American Embassy or Consulate.

The Biden administration conducted its first deportation flight to Venezuela in years, sending over 100 Venezuelans back to their home country. The Department of Homeland Security made the decision to resume direct repatriations in an effort to discourage illegal border crossings, following an agreement with Venezuelan authorities to accept the return of their nationals. Corey Price, an acting executive associate director for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, stated that there would be several more flights in the coming days and weeks.
The migrants on the flight had illegally entered the US between ports of entry and were prioritized based on recent arrivals and criminal history. Since President Biden took office, nearly half a million Venezuelans have illegally crossed the southwest border, with a peak of over 34,000 arrests in April. To address this, Biden extended temporary protected status to around 472,000 Venezuelan migrants, allowing them to live and work legally in the US. However, those who have not applied for TPS and have deportation orders could still face removal. Immigration attorneys are advising eligible Venezuelans to apply for TPS promptly to avoid deportation.
The Biden administration's decision to conduct its first deportation flight to Venezuela in years is aimed at discouraging illegal border crossings and addressing the influx of Venezuelan migrants entering the US. With an agreement in place with Venezuelan authorities to accept repatriations, the Department of Homeland Security made the move to resume direct deportations. Corey Price, acting executive associate director for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, revealed that several more flights would be scheduled in the coming days and weeks.
The individuals on the deportation flight had entered the US illegally between ports of entry, and were chosen based on factors such as recent arrival and criminal history. The number of Venezuelans crossing the southwest border illegally has reached a staggering half a million since President Biden took office. Meanwhile, in an effort to provide relief to Venezuelan migrants, Biden extended temporary protected status to approximately 472,000 individuals, granting them legal rights to live and work in the US.

3092,3692,Summarize the following news within 193 words:,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)It is a strangely detached scene for the close of America's longest war: military trainers bouncing between multi-million dollar, high security bases, on Black Hawks, miles from the front line. But it is how Washington wants this to be. And even though the departure of American troops will be fractionally slower, they will all be inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year, making these some of their last weeks outside of the wire. We are near Jalalabad, at a regional logistics hub for the Afghan police force -- a generous facility that was originally intended to resupply the entire east of the country with uniforms, ammunition, even fuel for vehicles. The intentions, first hatched in 2011 when the U.S. had tens of thousands of troops and still large ambitions for their war here, were large in scale. But the project has been handed between rotations of U.S. officers and is perhaps a little distant from its first conception. We are taken on a proud tour of a series of clean and newly painted blocks. Dozens of Afghan police gather there, and mill around, waiting for their commanders to arrive. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: Afghan forced to marry her rapist. Yet a few problems are immediately visible. There are no doorhandles on the outer doors -- we're told they've been removed while a new master key is being sought. There seem to be few supplies in the actual hub. We ask the Afghan policemen how many of them get resupplied there, at this stage, four months since it opened, and they say: none. About 20 units a month file paperwork for resupply in the base, but supplies often still come from where they did before -- Kabul. U.S. officials told us they are optimistic the logistical road ahead can be smoothed -- that in the 18 plus months they have left they can get the Afghan army and police up to furnishing themselves with the supply lines they need. But here, now, that seems far away. As does the base, incidentally. It's quite a rough drive from the main road, surrounded by hills, and with at best patchy cellphone coverage -- far from ideal for a transit hub. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: ISIS recruits in Taliban territory. And it is far away in terms of its cost. Like so much in the most costly of wars, its price tag may have made sense in briefings on Capitol Hill, where effectiveness is gauged in millions, but here in dusty eastern Afghanistan, it seems exorbitant. This as-yet, partially functional resupply hub cost $21 million, a price that presumably includes new doorhandles. There are about fifty Afghan police currently on the base -- meaning each one has so far cost $400,000 to the US taxpayer. But this is an unfair way of representing the challenge the U.S. trainers here face: working, as they are, against a clock, with diminishing resources and public interest, in an endlessly complex and often corrupt land where, when the Taliban aren't thriving, ISIS are waiting in the wings to fill the gap. With the clock ticking in the background, U.S. officer Colonel JB Vowell remains upbeat: ""It's going to be a challenge, to get all those little hubs and spokes -- logistics to maintenance, supplies, resupply. I'm optimistic though; much of this didn't exist in November."" On the outskirts of the base are the relics of the U.S.'s military involvement in a conflict that still continues to kill Afghan security forces at an accelerated  rate. SUVs, even old American Humvees -- now gifted to Afghan police to drive around -- lie disabled by mine strikes. The Americans were hoping the police could stack the vehicles here, assess their resupply needs, or cannibalize the damaged vehicles for spare parts. Throughout, the surreal changes in how this war was, and continues to be, fought are omnipresent. Years ago, the threat would have mostly been from insurgents taking potshots at an American base. Now we are far from the threat, but another has taken its place. Surrounding our crew at all times are ""Guardian Angels"" -- U.S. soldiers on guard duty, protecting their own from rogue Afghan police or soldiers, trying to prevent the newest and most serious scourge -- ""green on blue"" attacks, in which Afghan security forces turn their guns on Americans. It is a strange experience to be protected from those who America seeks to hand the country over to. But this is how the war ended. Not with ideological victories, or dramatic withdrawals, just the slow and deliberate stepping to one side.

output:","Kabul: U.S. Troops Prepare for Exit as Afghan War Ends

As the United States prepares for its exit from Afghanistan, it is a strange scene. Military trainers are leaving high security bases via Black Hawk helicopters and returning to the U.S. embassy. These are the last days outside the wire for these troops. Nick Paton Walsh reports on a tour of an Afghan police training center in Jalalabad. The facility, once meant to resupply the entire east of the country, has been handed between rotations of U.S. officers and seems distant from its initial intent. The Afghan policemen state that not a single unit gets resupplied through the base, with supplies coming from Kabul instead.

{'question': 'Summarize the following news within 193 words:', 'passages': 'Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)It is a strangely detached scene for the close of America\'s longest war: military trainers bouncing between multi-million dollar, high security bases, on Black Hawks, miles from the front line. But it is how Washington wants this to be. And even though the departure of American troops will be fractionally slower, they will all be inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year, making these some of their last weeks outside of the wire. We are near Jalalabad, at a regional logistics hub for the Afghan police force -- a generous facility that was originally intended to resupply the entire east of the country with uniforms, ammunition, even fuel for vehicles. The intentions, first hatched in 2011 when the U.S. had tens of thousands of troops and still large ambitions for their war here, were large in scale. But the project has been handed between rotations of U.S. officers and is perhaps a little distant from its first conception. We are taken on a proud tour of a series of clean and newly painted blocks. Dozens of Afghan police gather there, and mill around, waiting for their commanders to arrive. Nick Paton Walsh\'s Afghanistan series: Afghan forced to marry her rapist. Yet a few problems are immediately visible. There are no doorhandles on the outer doors -- we\'re told they\'ve been removed while a new master key is being sought. There seem to be few supplies in the actual hub. We ask the Afghan policemen how many of them get resupplied there, at this stage, four months since it opened, and they say: none. About 20 units a month file paperwork for resupply in the base, but supplies often still come from where they did before -- Kabul. U.S. officials told us they are optimistic the logistical road ahead can be smoothed -- that in the 18 plus months they have left they can get the Afghan army and police up to furnishing themselves with the supply lines they need. But here, now, that seems far away. As does the base, incidentally. It\'s quite a rough drive from the main road, surrounded by hills, and with at best patchy cellphone coverage -- far from ideal for a transit hub. Nick Paton Walsh\'s Afghanistan series: ISIS recruits in Taliban territory. And it is far away in terms of its cost. Like so much in the most costly of wars, its price tag may have made sense in briefings on Capitol Hill, where effectiveness is gauged in millions, but here in dusty eastern Afghanistan, it seems exorbitant. This as-yet, partially functional resupply hub cost $21 million, a price that presumably includes new doorhandles. There are about fifty Afghan police currently on the base -- meaning each one has so far cost $400,000 to the US taxpayer. But this is an unfair way of representing the challenge the U.S. trainers here face: working, as they are, against a clock, with diminishing resources and public interest, in an endlessly complex and often corrupt land where, when the Taliban aren\'t thriving, ISIS are waiting in the wings to fill the gap. With the clock ticking in the background, U.S. officer Colonel JB Vowell remains upbeat: ""It\'s going to be a challenge, to get all those little hubs and spokes -- logistics to maintenance, supplies, resupply. I\'m optimistic though; much of this didn\'t exist in November."" On the outskirts of the base are the relics of the U.S.\'s military involvement in a conflict that still continues to kill Afghan security forces at an accelerated  rate. SUVs, even old American Humvees -- now gifted to Afghan police to drive around -- lie disabled by mine strikes. The Americans were hoping the police could stack the vehicles here, assess their resupply needs, or cannibalize the damaged vehicles for spare parts. Throughout, the surreal changes in how this war was, and continues to be, fought are omnipresent. Years ago, the threat would have mostly been from insurgents taking potshots at an American base. Now we are far from the threat, but another has taken its place. Surrounding our crew at all times are ""Guardian Angels"" -- U.S. soldiers on guard duty, protecting their own from rogue Afghan police or soldiers, trying to prevent the newest and most serious scourge -- ""green on blue"" attacks, in which Afghan security forces turn their guns on Americans. It is a strange experience to be protected from those who America seeks to hand the country over to. But this is how the war ended. Not with ideological victories, or dramatic withdrawals, just the slow and deliberate stepping to one side.\n\noutput:'}

Kabul: U.S. Troops Prepare for Exit as Afghan War Ends

As the United States prepares for its exit from Afghanistan, it is a strange scene. Military trainers are leaving high security bases via Black Hawk helicopters and returning to the U.S. embassy. These are the last days outside the wire for these troops. Nick Paton Walsh reports on a tour of an Afghan police training center in Jalalabad. The facility, once meant to resupply the entire east of the country, has been handed between rotations of U.S. officers and seems distant from its initial intent. The Afghan policemen state that not a single unit gets resupplied through the base, with supplies coming from Kabul instead. A logistics road lies ahead for the Afghan army and police to obtain the necessary supply lines, but the challenge remains given the complex nature of the situation. Colonel JB Vowell believes that the war will end after 18-plus months, but many question the stability of the country. There have been 70,000 casualties among Afghan security forces since 2016, and ISIS is still present.

The Heartbreaking Disappearance of Raymond Green Jr. from Atlanta, Georgia, in 1978
In a harrowing incident from 1978, a newborn was abducted, leaving a young mother devastated and a family torn apart for decades. Donna Green, who was just 16 at the time, gave birth to Raymond Green Jr. at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 1st. It was a joyous occasion as Raymond Jr. was the couple’s second child, with their first daughter, Raymonda, born just a year prior.
However, the joy was short-lived. Donna was befriended by a woman named Lisa Morris at the hospital. This woman claimed that her sister had recently given birth and expressed a keen interest in Donna's life and her newborn son.
After gaining Donna's trust, Lisa visited the Green residence on November 6, where she skillfully maneuvered her way to be left alone with baby Raymond. Seizing this opportunity, Lisa kidnapped the child. A witness spotted her entering a brown van holding a baby, which quickly drove off, marking the beginning of a heart-wrenching search.
Despite Donna's desperate attempts to locate her son, her pleas fell largely on deaf ears. According to Donna, her socio-economic status and racial background meant that her son's disappearance didn't garner the media attention or the urgency it deserved.
An investigation revealed that the mysterious 'Lisa Morris' had provided false information to Donna. Descriptions of Lisa paint her as a Black woman in her early 20s, about 5'6"" tall, weighing 170 lbs, with distinctive scars on her forehead and a mole on her left cheek.
The emotional aftermath of this tragedy was significant. Donna and her boyfriend, Raymond Green, drifted apart due to the blame game that ensued. However, love found its way back and the couple reconciled in 1990, expanding their family with five more children and enjoying the company of twelve grandchildren. Raymond Sr., however, passed away in 1999.
Raymond Jr.'s disappearance remains a gaping hole in Donna's heart. In her persistent search for answers, she has explored multiple avenues, including submitting her DNA to ancestry platforms in hopes of a familial match.
Recently, there's been a renewed effort to solve this 40-year-old mystery. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children has released an age-progressed photo of what Raymond Jr. might look like today, and this image will be widely circulated across gas stations in the U.S.
For anyone with potential information regarding Raymond Green Jr.'s whereabouts, they are urged to contact the Atlanta Police Department at 1-404-658-6666. The hope remains that one day the Green family will find closure.

The Growing Up Chrisley star got personal with her fans in a Q&A where she was asked about her plans for next year.
Not surprisingly, Todd and Julie Chrisley, currently serving time in separate prisons, instantly came to mind.
Savannah confessed that she wants her parents back home in 2024, but she’ll take even one of them because she misses her mom and dad “like crazy.”
Her parents reported to federal prison earlier this year but recently had their sentences reduced. Todd is now set for release in 2033 and Julie in 2028, but that could be further reduced, and Savannah is hoping for a miracle.
It’s been hard on the 26-year-old who stepped up and became the legal guardian for her younger siblings, Grayson and Chloe Chrisley.
Savannah Chrisley is hopeful that her parents will be released in 2024
Savannah opened up to her Instagram followers in a recent Q&A after someone asked about her plans for next year.
“I hope that Mom and Dad are home,” she responded, “Both, one of them, I will take anything at this point. I miss them like crazy, and I continue to fight day in and day out for them.”
Savannah also noted that she has founded an organization she hopes will be up and running by next year.
The reality TV personality said she’s “in the process of launching” the company, allowing her to “Fight for those who can’t fight for themselves.”
“I am so passionate about that,” exclaimed Savannah in the clip as she reiterated her first sentiment and added, “Also, I just hope Mom and Dad are home.”
Savannah Chrisley admits to having many regrets
An Instagram follower also asked Savannah if she had any regrets, and she didn’t give the cliche answer but instead got honest about her feelings.
“I do have regrets, especially this past year, my life has been filled with so much loss,” she admitted.
Savannah mentioned her parents, Todd and Julie, and her ex-fiance Nick Kerdiles, who passed away in September after sustaining fatal injuries in a motorcycle accident.
“I definitely regret not living life truly to the fullest. I regret certain things that have been said, actions. I regret not loving a little better,” she said.
Before ending the video, Savannah gave her followers a word of advice and told them to “Love. Love harder. Let the little things go. Fighting is not worth it.”

2911,3493,Summarize the following news within 141 words:,"Tikrit, Iraq (CNN)Mass graves believed to hold Iraqi soldiers have been discovered in newly liberated Tikrit. Up to 1,700 bodies may be recovered. ISIS claimed to have executed that many soldiers captured in June outside Camp Speicher, a fortified Iraqi base near Tikrit. A total of 47 bodies have been exhumed from two of the 11 mass graves discovered in Tikrit, an Iraqi government official said Tuesday. Hundreds are believed to have been executed by ISIS in June 2014. Grieving Iraqis, apparently not related to the soldiers, gathered to pray over the bodies. When the first three bodies were found, 10 Iraqi soldiers saluted the dead by firing seven shots into the air. The national anthem was played while soldiers wept. All the bodies were decomposed. Some had their hands bound, Damon said. The remains will be sent back to Baghdad for DNA tests to establish identify, said Ali Tahir, a director in the Iraqi morgue who was supervising the digging and extraction. Damon said there may be eight mass graves inside the presidential palace complex, which contains the residences of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and two other sites outside the city. The presidential palaces complex became ISIS headquarters after the militants occupied the city. Iraqi soldiers and Shiite militias retook Tikrit a few days ago after a fierce battle. Damon interviewed a soldier who said he survived the massacre by playing dead. The solider said ISIS captured the troops outside Camp Speicher and marched them to the presidential palace complex, telling them they would be safe until a prisoner swap was arranged. Once inside the compound, the soldiers were separated into smaller groups, executed and buried in mass graves, the survivor told Damon. He said he was tossed into a river and floated to an embankment. On Monday, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said revenge is not the way to deal with the discovery of the bodies. He said several people involved in the killings have been detained. Families of the missing soldiers had been demanding answers from the Iraqi government about what happened. As ISIS swept through northern Iraq in June, some military units were ordered to Camp Speicher. Their families claim the men received orders from their commanders to leave the base and move closer to Baghdad. They left unarmed and in civilian clothes, they say. Military commanders and the Iraqi Defense Ministry denied any such orders being issued and said the men deserted. ISIS released videos that showed what seemed to be an endless line of military recruits marched at gunpoint and later posted images showing cold-blooded mass killings. Damon said Iraqi officials told her it may take weeks or months to exhume all the bodies. Human Rights Watch described the ""Speicher Massacre"" -- as it has been dubbed in Iraq -- as the ""largest reported incident"" where ""ISIS captured more than 1,000 soldiers fleeing Camp Speicher ... then summarily executed at least 800 of them."" Based on satellite imagery and witness testimony, Human Rights Watch last year was able to identity a number of mass grave sites inside Tikrit and the presidential palace complex. The families gave DNA samples to the Iraqi Ministry of Health last year so authorities would be able to match them to unidentified bodies the government may find. CNN's Arwa Damon reported from Tikrit, and Ralph Ellis wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.

{'question': 'Summarize the following news within 141 words:', 'passages': 'Tikrit, Iraq (CNN)Mass graves believed to hold Iraqi soldiers have been discovered in newly liberated Tikrit. Up to 1,700 bodies may be recovered. ISIS claimed to have executed that many soldiers captured in June outside Camp Speicher, a fortified Iraqi base near Tikrit. A total of 47 bodies have been exhumed from two of the 11 mass graves discovered in Tikrit, an Iraqi government official said Tuesday. Hundreds are believed to have been executed by ISIS in June 2014. Grieving Iraqis, apparently not related to the soldiers, gathered to pray over the bodies. When the first three bodies were found, 10 Iraqi soldiers saluted the dead by firing seven shots into the air. The national anthem was played while soldiers wept. All the bodies were decomposed. Some had their hands bound, Damon said. The remains will be sent back to Baghdad for DNA tests to establish identify, said Ali Tahir, a director in the Iraqi morgue who was supervising the digging and extraction. Damon said there may be eight mass graves inside the presidential palace complex, which contains the residences of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and two other sites outside the city. The presidential palaces complex became ISIS headquarters after the militants occupied the city. Iraqi soldiers and Shiite militias retook Tikrit a few days ago after a fierce battle. Damon interviewed a soldier who said he survived the massacre by playing dead. The solider said ISIS captured the troops outside Camp Speicher and marched them to the presidential palace complex, telling them they would be safe until a prisoner swap was arranged. Once inside the compound, the soldiers were separated into smaller groups, executed and buried in mass graves, the survivor told Damon. He said he was tossed into a river and floated to an embankment. On Monday, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said revenge is not the way to deal with the discovery of the bodies. He said several people involved in the killings have been detained. Families of the missing soldiers had been demanding answers from the Iraqi government about what happened. As ISIS swept through northern Iraq in June, some military units were ordered to Camp Speicher. Their families claim the men received orders from their commanders to leave the base and move closer to Baghdad. They left unarmed and in civilian clothes, they say. Military commanders and the Iraqi Defense Ministry denied any such orders being issued and said the men deserted. ISIS released videos that showed what seemed to be an endless line of military recruits marched at gunpoint and later posted images showing cold-blooded mass killings. Damon said Iraqi officials told her it may take weeks or months to exhume all the bodies. Human Rights Watch described the ""Speicher Massacre"" -- as it has been dubbed in Iraq -- as the ""largest reported incident"" where ""ISIS captured more than 1,000 soldiers fleeing Camp Speicher ... then summarily executed at least 800 of them."" Based on satellite imagery and witness testimony, Human Rights Watch last year was able to identity a number of mass grave sites inside Tikrit and the presidential palace complex. The families gave DNA samples to the Iraqi Ministry of Health last year so authorities would be able to match them to unidentified bodies the government may find. CNN\'s Arwa Damon reported from Tikrit, and Ralph Ellis wrote in Atlanta. CNN\'s Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.\n\noutput:'}

Meghan McCain is familiar to viewers of The View since she was a controversial co-host from 2017 to 2021.
The 38-year-old daughter of the late Senator John McCain has been speaking out lately on various things.
Her new podcast, Meghan McCain Has Entered the Chat, premiers October 17, 2023.
The podcast is her first large project since she left The View in 2021. It is reported to be part hard news and part entertainment.
Meghan has created her own production company even though she is so done with television and finds it superficial.
But that clearly won’t stop her from talking about it on her podcast and as she promotes that podcast, she cannot stop talking about and throwing shade at her former show, The View.
Meghan cannot stop talking about The View
For a talk show aimed at women, The View has had its share of former co-hosts speaking out about their experiences.
Meghan McCain and Rosie O’Donnell are the most recent ladies taking their grievances public.
Rosie O’Donnell had a terrible time and accused the producers of giving preferential treatment to specific hosts and moderators.
Meghan, in an interview about her new company and podcast, revealed who she misses on The View.
First, she clarified that she doesn’t “watch it at all.” Telling The Messenger that it is like “going through an ex-boyfriend’s Instagram.”
And while Meghan does miss some of the people from The View, she certainly wasn’t talking about her former co-hosts.
Instead, she claims to miss the wardrobe crew, calling them “very kind.” She also pointed out the real reason why she missed them.
In a contradiction of her comments about working in television as being “superficial,” she said that she likes “getting dressed up.”
Sunny thinks Meghan would be great on this television show
There is a certain amount of animosity between the ladies. Meghan has said terrible things about her time on The View in the media.
As previously reported by Monsters and Critics, Meghan is quoted as saying, “As for me – may the bridges I burn light the way.”
For Sunny to even mention Meghan during an interview could mean that she is trying to get a dig in on her ex-colleague.
According to Sunny, Meghan’s husband mean-tweeted her on social media even though Sunny considered Meghan a friend.
Sunny suggested to Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live that Meghan would be perfect in a Bravo show, The Real Housewives of Potomac.
The View airs weekdays at 11/10c on ABC.

Joy Behar stepped in as moderator today on The View. Whoopi Goldberg usually fills this spot, but she was missing today.
The odd part of Whoopi not being in her typical head-of-the-table seat is that it is a Wednesday. Whoopi has been taking the day off on Fridays.
The previous Friday was a celebration for Joy Behar, and Whoopi was not in the studio.
Joy had to fill in as moderator on that day. Unfortunately, she was not excited that the ladies celebrated her birthday on the show.
Joy had to moderate the previous Friday, too, as Whoopi was also gone.
Joy was called out during that show for being “bored” during a segment featuring Carlos Vives as he celebrated the National Hispanic Heritage Month.
Within seconds of The View airing, fans were asking about Whoopi
Today, Joy announced, “Welcome to The View. As you can see, Whoopi is off today.”
Viewers immediately took to social media, wondering what happened to Whoopi.
According to Joy, Whoopi Goldberg’s absence from The View is for a special project.
Joy continued her announcement, “She’s off doing something really exciting. But I can’t tell you what it is because we want you to watch on Monday.”
Joy finished her announcement by promising the viewers, “…She’ll tell you what it is, okay? Trust me, it’s a good one.”
Whoopi has previously missed The View
In just the six short weeks of season 27 of The View, Whoopi has missed several days besides her Fridays off.
In fact, Whoopi had to miss the premier of this season. It was revealed on the September 5 show by Joy Behar to the audience, “As you can see, Whoopi is not here today. She has COVID-19.”
Joy had to step in as moderator during the time Whoopi took to recover.
As previously reported by Monsters and Critics, Joy did not mind stepping into the role. Joy confessed to being a bit of a “control freak” who enjoys the moderator role.
It is safe to speculate that if Whoopi prolongs her time away, Joy Behar will happily continue in the moderator seat.
Whether Whoopi will be out the rest of the week is still unknown.
The only bit of knowledge was Joy saying that Monday is the day Whoopi will reveal what she has been up to during her absence.
The View airs weekdays at 11/10c on ABC.

1121,1433,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"For years, when I'd tell new friends I was half-Armenian, a puzzled look would cross their faces, before they'd ask something like, ""Do you have a country?"" Or, when there was a spark of recognition, they'd chortle, ""Ah, you're the people with the last names all ending in 'ian'!"" In fact, one of our most famous Armenians, Cher, was better known for her Oscar-winning portrayals of Italians, and had dropped her own identifying surname. The decimation of our people, too, was reduced to a footnote -- if we were lucky -- in tomes about World War I, when more than one million Armenians were killed during the last days of the Ottoman Empire. Most of the time, though, the coverage was about how Armenians and Turks hate each other like cats and dogs, that the Turks continue to deny that ethnic cleansing occurred, saying the Armenians had hatched a rebellion, and that the leaders had no choice but to deport them from their homes and put them on the road that led to their deaths. Even Adolf Hitler had brushed us aside, uttering, just before invading Poland in September 1939: ""Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?"" according to the former bureau chief of The Associated Press in Berlin, Louis Lochner. Apparently he hadn't the anticipated the Kardashian juggernaut. As Kim Kardashian, sister Khloe and their two cousins recently toured Armenia -- on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the mass killings, which is marked on April 24 -- they spotlighted a humanitarian crime that Pope Francis recently called ""the first genocide of the 20th century."" Suddenly, the poor landlocked country of Armenia was trending. Standing in front of the statute of ""Mother Armenia,"" Kim seemed to seize the label herself, and the adoring crowds appeared to agree. On another stop of her tour, she dressed in a red jumpsuit, and placed tulips at the slate gray Armenian Genocide memorial complex, bringing new color to an issue and to a people who usually pay tribute to their dead relatives every year in their best funereal black. After the Kardashian trip to Armenia, my elderly mother Anahid called me nearly breathless with pride:  ""Have you seen? The genocide is all over the news! That famous lady, Kim Kardashian, has done it!"" My mother's own father, Stepan Miskjian, with his own ""ian"" surname, had narrowly survived the killings. He told of how an entire caravan of thousands was killed in what's now eastern Syria, and that he only escaped by waiting until night and crawling out on his hands and knees past the ring of guards, and then crossing the desert for six days with only enough water to fill two cups. When the Kardashians first rose to fame, many Armenians cringed over their potboiler storyline, their million-dollar weddings to basketball players and rappers, multiple divorces, and a clothing line at Sears. Through their fame, though, people began to learn about Armenians -- even people outside Los Angeles, where the Armenian population is as thick as the Kardashian hair. That Americans may also have been equating the ancient culture with the latest ""Keeping Up with the Kardashian"" plotline was a source of discomfort for the community. But every once in a while, Kim Kardashian would tweet something about the issue -- and slowly the community began to warm to her. Meanwhile, many Armenians continued to brainstorm about how to convince Turkey to acknowledge the truth about what happened, and how to persuade the President Barack Obama to label the killings ""genocide,"" as he promised when first campaigning for the highest office. We cheered and forwarded emails every time a rumor surfaced that Steven Spielberg was going to take one of our family stories to the big screen, give us our own ""Schindler's List,"" and hoped maybe now the world would be forced to listen. And we would deflate when it wouldn't come to fruition. And every April 24, the day in 1915 when Ottoman Turks began rounding up the community's intellectual leaders, we mobilized. And we will do so again this year, holding candlelight vigils, concerts, and protest marches, while waving the Armenian flag, even though many of us have never been to the country ourselves. We also press forward on the academic front, holding conferences on the latest research around the world, exulting in the discovery of yet another bit of information that would surely make the world reckon, that would counter Turkey's steadfast pressure on the United States to not acknowledge the atrocities. And still, disappointingly, early reports surfaced yet once more, as in years before, that Obama has decided again on this year's anniversary not to use the g-word. Despite all the setbacks, the Armenians will continue to speak out, and hopefully find some hallowed ground, too, to stand with Turks to heal. After all, we've learned an increased dialogue can come from the most surprising places. This year, it took a reality star, famous for balancing a cocktail on her rump, to catapult it to the top of the news once again, like it was on December 15, 1915, when headlines like ""Million Armenians Killed or in Exile,"" splashed across the New York Times and other international media. After a century of trying to raise awareness, what we needed all along was a television and Internet persona to join us -- especially one who shares everything on every platform -- to shed light on a crime that occurred back when telegrams were the speedy form of communication, and photographic plates of the killings had to be smuggled out in a belt, rather than blasted instantaneously with a tweet. The queen of the selfies has finally used her attention for good, and hopefully it won't be as short-lived as some of her other memes. That's a crusade I can follow in any medium.

He told of how an entire caravan of thousands was killed in what\'s now eastern Syria, and that he only escaped by waiting until night and crawling out on his hands and knees past the ring of guards, and then crossing the desert for six days with only enough water to fill two cups. When the Kardashians first rose to fame, many Armenians cringed over their potboiler storyline, their million-dollar weddings to basketball players and rappers, multiple divorces, and a clothing line at Sears. Through their fame, though, people began to learn about Armenians -- even people outside Los Angeles, where the Armenian population is as thick as the Kardashian hair. That Americans may also have been equating the ancient culture with the latest ""Keeping Up with the Kardashian"" plotline was a source of discomfort for the community. But every once in a while, Kim Kardashian would tweet something about the issue -- and slowly the community began to warm to her. Meanwhile, many Armenians continued to brainstorm about how to convince Turkey to acknowledge the truth about what happened, and how to persuade the President Barack Obama to label the killings ""genocide,"" as he promised when first campaigning for the highest office. We cheered and forwarded emails every time a rumor surfaced that Steven Spielberg was going to take one of our family stories to the big screen, give us our own ""Schindler\'s List,"" and hoped maybe now the world would be forced to listen. And we would deflate when it wouldn\'t come to fruition. And every April 24, the day in 1915 when Ottoman Turks began rounding up the community\'s intellectual leaders, we mobilized. And we will do so again this year, holding candlelight vigils, concerts, and protest marches, while waving the Armenian flag, even though many of us have never been to the country ourselves. We also press forward on the academic front, holding conferences on the latest research around the world, exulting in the discovery of yet another bit of information that would surely make the world reckon, that would counter Turkey\'s steadfast pressure on the United States to not acknowledge the atrocities. And still, disappointingly, early reports surfaced yet once more, as in years before, that Obama has decided again on this year\'s anniversary not to use the g-word. Despite all the setbacks, the Armenians will continue to speak out, and hopefully find some hallowed ground, too, to stand with Turks to heal. After all, we\'ve learned an increased dialogue can come from the most surprising places. This year, it took a reality star, famous for balancing a cocktail on her rump, to catapult it to the top of the news once again, like it was on December 15, 1915, when headlines like ""Million Armenians Killed or in Exile,"" splashed across the New York Times and other international media. After a century of trying to raise awareness, what we needed all along was a television and Internet persona to join us -- especially one who shares everything on every platform -- to shed light on a crime that occurred back when telegrams were the speedy form of communication, and photographic plates of the killings had to be smuggled out in a belt, rather than blasted instantaneously with a tweet. The queen of the selfies has finally used her attention for good, and hopefully it won\'t be as short-lived as some of her other memes. That\'s a crusade I can follow in any medium.\n\noutput:'}
Below is a summary of the news:
The article discusses how Kim Kardashian's recent visit to Armenia and her recognition of the Armenian Genocide has brought attention to the issue, which has been largely ignored for centuries. The author describes how the genocide, which occurred during World War I, resulted in the deaths of over one million Armenians and how it has been denied by Turkey. The author also mentions how the Kardashian sisters' visit to Armenia and their meeting with the Prime Minister has brought renewed attention to the issue, with even the Pope recognizing it as the ""first genocide of the 20th century."" The article ends by expressing hope that the increased dialogue brought about by Kim Kardashian's visit will lead to a greater awareness and recognition of the genocide, and that it will eventually lead to healing and reconciliation between Armenians and Turks.

Boardwine's friend, Joyce Bruce, had used his sperm and a turkey baster to get pregnant. She thought after she learned she was with child that they should just be friends. She also thought that because they never had sex, she was entitled to be the boy's sole parent, according to court documents.

Bruce argued that she used ""noncoital reproductive technology"" to get pregnant, and Boardwine was technically a sperm donor. He argued that he always expected to be a dad, going to the kid's games and taking part in making decisions on schools and medical needs.

By Dan Schlossberg
The Tampa Bay Rays now have the winter to wonder why they bounced out of the post-season so quickly — and why so few fans showed up to support them.
They’ve announced plans to build a new $1.3 billion ballpark, which is the good news, but foolishly agreed to build it in the same St. Petersburg location that makes rush-hour commuting to night games difficult if not impossible.
Only 19,704 fans showed up to the first game of the American League Wild-Card Series. It was the worst total in an uninterrupted season since 1919 (that’s no typo).
The Rays revived this year, adding power to their performance, and nearly won 100 games. They have a .586 winning percentage and a World Series performance over the past six years.
Yet attendance has been such an issue that the team actually played three official games at Disney World’s Champions Stadium, which holds only 11,000 when full.
The idea to make the Rays a regional team is not new; ownership even floated the concept of splitting “home” games between Tampa Bay and Montreal, provided a stadium could be built to replace The Big O.
With the possible exception of the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum — or whatever the A’s call their moribund ballpark — Tropicana Field is far and away the worst facility in the major leagues. And we did mention where it is? As Greg Maddux might say, ‘Location, location, location.’
The Rays are always a solid team but have averaged only 20,000 per game since 2010.
Isn’t that enough of a sample size for anyone to the team plays in a bad park in a bad location?
Time is not the issue either. Consider the crowds at other afternoon playoff games:
The Braves drew 42,461 to Windy Hill for Game 1 of their 2022 NLDS game, which started at 1 o’clock on a Tuesday afternoon. And getting to Truist Park by mass transportation is a pain in the you-know-what.
Earlier this week, the Minnesota Twins attracted 38,450 for their Wild Card game at 3:30 in the afternoon. Even manager Rocco Baldelli noticed, saying, “The fans took over and helped us win the game.”
After a 99-win season, the Rays won the battle but not the war. Before they start digging the foundations of their new edifice, they need to find a viable location.
Otherwise, their problems will continue — especially after the novelty of the new place wears off in a year or two.

Meghan McCain is familiar to viewers of The View since she was a controversial co-host from 2017 to 2021.
The 38-year-old daughter of the late Senator John McCain has been speaking out lately on various things.
Her new podcast, Meghan McCain Has Entered the Chat, premiers October 17, 2023.
The podcast is her first large project since she left The View in 2021. It is reported to be part hard news and part entertainment.
Meghan has created her own production company even though she is so done with television and finds it superficial.
But that clearly won’t stop her from talking about it on her podcast and as she promotes that podcast, she cannot stop talking about and throwing shade at her former show, The View.
Meghan cannot stop talking about The View
For a talk show aimed at women, The View has had its share of former co-hosts speaking out about their experiences.
Meghan McCain and Rosie O’Donnell are the most recent ladies taking their grievances public.
Rosie O’Donnell had a terrible time and accused the producers of giving preferential treatment to specific hosts and moderators.
Meghan, in an interview about her new company and podcast, revealed who she misses on The View.
First, she clarified that she doesn’t “watch it at all.” Telling The Messenger that it is like “going through an ex-boyfriend’s Instagram.”
And while Meghan does miss some of the people from The View, she certainly wasn’t talking about her former co-hosts.
Instead, she claims to miss the wardrobe crew, calling them “very kind.” She also pointed out the real reason why she missed them.
In a contradiction of her comments about working in television as being “superficial,” she said that she likes “getting dressed up.”
Sunny thinks Meghan would be great on this television show
There is a certain amount of animosity between the ladies. Meghan has said terrible things about her time on The View in the media.
As previously reported by Monsters and Critics, Meghan is quoted as saying, “As for me – may the bridges I burn light the way.”
For Sunny to even mention Meghan during an interview could mean that she is trying to get a dig in on her ex-colleague.
According to Sunny, Meghan’s husband mean-tweeted her on social media even though Sunny considered Meghan a friend.
Sunny suggested to Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live that Meghan would be perfect in a Bravo show, The Real Housewives of Potomac.
The View airs weekdays at 11/10c on ABC.

The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Dolores Catania has been working on herself since Season 13 of the Bravo show filmed.
She has admitted to using Ozempic to aid in weight loss, but some followers are concerned she is “too skinny” now.
Dolores has shared some looks from events she has attended, and one in particular caught the eye of followers.
Many expressed concern for the RHONJ star, but she didn’t seem bothered by the comments.
On Instagram, Dolores Catania shared a few photos of herself highlighting her recent weight loss.
She captioned the post, “they can steal your recipe but the sauce won’t taste the same 🤫”
There was also a cc for Kim Kardashian.
Dolores Catania has followers concerned
The comment section lit up with comments about Dolores Catania’s new look.
One follower wrote, “Are you starving yourself?”
Another worried about her being “too skinny,” saying, “You look amazing but I like a little bit of more meat on you. You look too skinny you look amazing and I love you but stop every man loves a little bit of thickness on him.”
Someone else accused Dolores of being “too obsessed” with her looks and changing too much because of plastic surgery.
Dolores Catania continues to play Switzerland on RHONJ
The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 14 is currently filming, and there has been plenty of drama.
Dolores Catania isn’t big on drama, so she typically remains Switzerland regarding things between Teresa Giudice and Melissa Gorga.
However, it will be interesting to see where she stands regarding what happened between Jennifer Aydin and Danielle Cabral. The ladies were paused from filming after an altercation drew blood from Danielle but went back to work shortly after the incident.
Most recently, Dolores attended a live taping of Teresa’s podcast alongside Jennifer, Jackie Golschneider, and Jennifer Fessler. The cast seems divided down the middle, with Dolores one of the only women who will attend events from both sides.
The RHONJ star has been living her best life with Paulie while sharing her updated weight loss progress. She doesn’t appear concerned that her followers are worried. Dolores has been honest about using Ozempic, admitting it on an episode of Watch What Happens Live.
Dolores hasn’t responded to the concern, and she likely won’t.
The Real Housewives of New Jersey is currently on hiatus.

It's been a bad couple of days (we are happy to report) for Cartel drug smugglers along the Texas - Mexico Border. The picture above is of a 400+ pound methamphetamine & Marijuana shipment seized by U.S. Customs & Border Protection Officer at the Bridge of the Americas in El Paso. The case has been turned over to the FBI and Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS).
Meanwhile, DPS pilots and U.S. Border Patrol Agents on the ground joined forces to interrupt a drug-smuggling operation in the West Texas desert near Van Horn.
In Laredo, U.S. Border Patrol Agents took down a 275+ pound load of marijuana worth well over $400,000.
In Hidalgo, CBP Officers discovered a 100+ pound load of methamphetamine smugglers attempted to drive across an International Bridge into Texas worth $930,000.
In Eagle Pass, Texas U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) Officers took down a 40+ pound load of cocaine being smuggled into the state worth more than $500,000.
In all, that's more than 800 pounds of dope worth well over $1,435,400 seized crossing into Texas over the past few days.
When combined with several bales of cocaine that have washed ashore along the Padre Island National Seashore in recent days that's more than $5,735,000 worth of drugs Federal Agents have seized in Texas!
Do law officers have enough resources to deal with drug smugglers along the Texas Border?

2382,2946,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"Talk show host Dr. Mehmet Oz is defending himself against a group of doctors who accuse him of ""manifesting an egregious lack of integrity"" in his TV and promotional work and who call his faculty position at Columbia University unacceptable. In a written statement issued last week, Oz said, ""I bring the public information that will help them on their path to be their best selves. We provide multiple points of view, including mine which is offered without conflict of interest.  That doesn't sit well with certain agendas which distort the facts. For example, I do not claim that GMO (genetically modified organism) foods are dangerous, but believe that they should be labeled like they are in most countries around the world. I will address this on the show next week."" That show was taped on Tuesday and in a clip posted online after the taping, he tells his audience he will not be silenced. The episode will air on Thursday afternoon in most markets, Friday in others. It all started when a group of 10 physicians from across the country emailed a letter to Columbia University expressing disapproval that Oz is on the faculty. The email sent to Columbia's faculty dean for Health Sciences and Medicine, Dr. Lee Goldman, said the group is ""surprised and dismayed"" that Oz is on faculty and that he holds a senior administrative position. Oz is vice chair of the Department of Surgery, at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. The email was sent by Dr. Henry Miller, a fellow in scientific philosophy and public policy at Stanford University's Hoover Institute. It was signed by nine other physicians from across the country, none of whom is affiliated with Columbia. They accuse Oz of what they call ""manifesting an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain."" They go on to say Oz has ""either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both."" The doctors argue in their emailed letter that Oz shows ""disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine, as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops."" It's worth noting that Miller previously worked at the FDA, at one point reviewing genetically engineered drugs. As an example, they cite an investigation reported on the show in 2011 in which apple juice was presented as having unsafe levels of arsenic. The FDA disputed the findings and said the report was misleading and irresponsible. This is not the first time Oz has been called out. He was in the hot seat on Capitol Hill at a June 2014 hearing on false advertising for deceptive weight loss products featured on his show. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, and chairwoman of the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Insurance, said at the hearing he was perpetuating scams, whether it was intentional or not. Miller and the other doctors who signed the email echo that sentiment, saying Oz is misleading the public and they tell Columbia's Goldman that having him on the faculty is unacceptable. The doctors, who are in different areas of the country and different facets of the medical community, all have a connection to Miller although they do not all know each other. CNN has reached out to all of them. Those who have responded say Miller invited them to sign the email. Orlando, Florida, anesthesiologist Dr. Shelley Fleet told CNN when she received an email from Miller inviting her to sign the email to Columbia, she said of course. ""He's a charlatan, and Columbia elevating him to a position of authority is a credence and platform for misleading more people,"" she said in a phone interview. Fleet was a classmate of Miller's at MIT. Dr. Joel Tepper, a radiology professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, is also a former classmate of Miller's. He told CNN he does not have a vendetta against Oz. He said he just wants him to ""follow the basic rules of science and state what he knows as fact as fact and state what he doesn't know as fact as not fact."" He and Fleet share McCaskill's example of Oz's promotion of ""miracle weight loss drugs"" on the show as failure on Oz's part to follow the oath taken by doctors to do no harm. Dr. Gordon Gill, professor emeritus of medicine and of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of San Diego School of Medicine, wrote in a letter to CNN: ""In discussions with Henry, I agreed that the imprimatur of Columbia Medical School behind Dr. Oz gave an inaccurate message to TV viewers and as Dr. Goldman and I are long time colleagues I was comfortable pointing out these problems to him."" Miller worked in Gill's research lab before he went to medical school. While the email does not call for any specific action to be taken by the university, Miller told CNN in an email that the group's goal is ""for Dr. Oz to resign from the Columbia faculty and decide that he'd prefer a career as a TV celebrity doctor."" Oz spokesman Tim Sullivan sent an email to CNN last week listing the names of five of the 10 people who complained about Oz. The email questions the integrity and even the qualifications of those who are pointing fingers at Oz. For its part, Columbia University is standing by Oz. Spokesman Doug Levy said in a statement, ""Columbia is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion."" Levy added that the university's role is to foster research, and it will not take action that hinders public statements by faculty members. The university has no position on what faculty members say in public discussion -- that is their individual academic freedom and is provided to them in the university's governing documents, he said. A cardiac surgeon, Oz came to Columbia for his residency after medical school in 1986 and rose through the ranks. He is also the director of the Cardiovascular Institute and Complementary Medicine program at New York Presbyterian Hospital. Oz rose to fame after frequent appearances on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" led to the creation of his own show and magazine. He is also co-founder of the consumer health website Sharecare.com. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Anne Woolsey and Kim Berryman contributed to this report.

Park has said that she is taking the accusations very seriously. Before departing on her trip to Central and South America, she condemned political corruption in her country. ""Corruption and deep-rooted evil are issues that can lead to taking away people\'s lives. We take this very seriously."" ""We must make sure to set straight this issue as a matter of political reform. I will not forgive anyone who is responsible for corruption or wrongdoing."" Park is in Peru and is expected to arrive back to South Korea on April 27. CNN\'s Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.\n\noutput:'}

3958,4762,Summarize the following news within 88 words:,"Tracking Flu in the USA: A Look at Texas
I like tracking how the seasonal flu is impacting the USA because it's a more dangerous disease than most Americans think — Texas and other southern states have been hit hard early into this flu season. About 12,000-52,000 people die each year in the USA on average. It's not at COVID-19 levels, but it's generally the most dangerous infectious disease that hits the world each year.
Of course, there is a vaccine for that, though flu vaccine uptake is much lower than other vaccines.
Let's take a look at where the flu has been particularly bad, especially in Texas.
Texas flu situation
Walgreens, the large drugstore chain, publishes data on anti-viral medications prescribed for flu as a good proxy for flu levels in a particular geographic region or city. According to their data, the flu season has been particularly hard on these Texas cities:
Harlingen-Weslaco-Brownsville-McAllen, TX
Beaumont-Port Arthur, TX
El Paso, TX
Corpus Christi, TX
Houston, TX
Other cities, outside of Texas, which have also been particularly hard hit are:
San Juan, PR
Las Cruces, NM
New Orleans, LA
Columbus-Tupelo-West Point-Houston, MS
Honolulu, HI
Miami-Ft. Lauderdale, FL
From a more general clinical perspective, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes weekly ""Influenza Surveillance Reports."" As of 6 October 2023, the CDC reports:
Nationally, 444 (1%) positive specimens reported last week. This is early in the flu season (which starts generally on 1 October), so the numbers will be low.
1,040 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were admitted to a hospital.
11 additional influenza-related deaths were reported last week.
Summary
If you live in these cities in Texas along with other cities that have been hit hard, you should really consider getting the flu vaccine. The flu is not a trivial disease, it is deadly and can be debilitating for a week or more.
People often confuse the flu with a common cold — they are two different diseases with different symptoms and different complications. The common cold is easy to handle, but the flu is not.
And just to be clear, the flu vaccine will not give you the flu, it will not harm you, and it is not filled with nanobots.
The flu vaccine saves lives.

764,1022,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)A day after winning Nigeria's presidency, Muhammadu Buhari told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he plans to aggressively fight corruption that has long plagued Nigeria and go after the root of the nation's unrest. Buhari said he'll ""rapidly give attention"" to curbing violence in the northeast part of Nigeria, where the terrorist group Boko Haram operates. By cooperating with neighboring nations Chad, Cameroon and Niger, he said his administration is confident it will be able to thwart criminals and others contributing to Nigeria's instability. For the first time in Nigeria's history, the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections. Buhari defeated incumbent Goodluck Jonathan by about 2 million votes, according to Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission. The win comes after a long history of military rule, coups and botched attempts at democracy in Africa's most populous nation. In an exclusive live interview from Abuja, Buhari told Amanpour he was not concerned about reconciling the nation after a divisive campaign. He said now that he has been elected he will turn his focus to Boko Haram and ""plug holes"" in the ""corruption infrastructure"" in the country. ""A new day and a new Nigeria are upon us,"" Buhari said after his win Tuesday. ""The victory is yours, and the glory is that of our nation."" Earlier, Jonathan phoned Buhari to concede defeat. The outgoing president also offered a written statement to his nation. ""I thank all Nigerians once again for the great opportunity I was given to lead this country, and assure you that I will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure,"" Jonathan said. ""I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word."" Buhari, 72, will be sworn in on May 29. He will take the helm at a critical time, as Nigeria grapples with Boko Haram, serious economic woes and corruption. This isn't Buhari's first time leading Nigeria, but it's his first time in nearly 30 years. A military coup brought Buhari to power in late 1983, closing a brief period of popular rule by Shehu Shagari. But Buhari himself was ousted by another military coup in August 1985. Read more: Who is Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari? His presidential win is the result of his fourth attempt to lead the country since he was ousted 30 years ago. Buhari is a Sunni Muslim from Nigeria's poorer North, while Jonathan comes from a Christian and animist South that is rich with oil. Buhari praised voters for exercising their right peacefully. ""Your vote affirms that you believe Nigeria's future can be better than what it is today,"" he said in his statement. ""You voted for change, and now change has come."" Buhari campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime. He stressed that Nigeria's security needs to be the next government's focus. His campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption. He ran under the slogan of ""new broom,"" and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote. Despite years of democracy, analysts say, corruption has hindered Nigeria from building a stable economy. One of Buhari's biggest challenges will be Boko Haram, which has been terrorizing Nigeria as it tries to institute a strict version of Sharia law in the country. In the past few years, the terror group has bombed churches and mosques, killed hundreds of people and kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school. Even the presidential vote had to be postponed because of the radical militants. The election was originally scheduled for February 14, but was delayed six weeks because the military needed more time to secure areas controlled by Boko Haram. Yet the violence persisted. On Saturday, residents in the northeastern state of Gombe said at least 11 people were killed in attacks at polling stations, apparently by Boko Haram extremists. Jonathan had been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram. Before the election, African affairs analyst Ayo Johnson said the vote would come down to who could make Nigeria feel safe. ""Many Nigerians will not forget (Buhari) was a military leader during a dictatorship,"" Johnson said. ""Or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism."" Boko Haram isn't the only obstacle facing the new president. The economy is another major issue. Nigeria overtook South Africa last year as the region's largest economy. Nigeria is one of Africa's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the United States. It also hosts many international oil companies and workers. But many complain that the country's vast wealth from oil exports doesn't trickle down to the average citizen. As many as 70% of Nigerians live below the poverty line, surviving on less than a dollar a day. Christian Purefoy reported from Lagos; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Stephanie Busari, Faith Karimi and Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.

""A new day and a new Nigeria are upon us,"" Buhari said after his win Tuesday. ""The victory is yours, and the glory is that of our nation."" Earlier, Jonathan phoned Buhari to concede defeat. The outgoing president also offered a written statement to his nation. ""I thank all Nigerians once again for the great opportunity I was given to lead this country, and assure you that I will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure,"" Jonathan said. ""I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word."" Buhari, 72, will be sworn in on May 29. He will take the helm at a critical time, as Nigeria grapples with Boko Haram, serious economic woes and corruption. This isn\'t Buhari\'s first time leading Nigeria, but it\'s his first time in nearly 30 years. A military coup brought Buhari to power in late 1983, closing a brief period of popular rule by Shehu Shagari. But Buhari himself was ousted by another military coup in August 1985. Read more: Who is Nigeria\'s Muhammadu Buhari? His presidential win is the result of his fourth attempt to lead the country since he was ousted 30 years ago. Buhari is a Sunni Muslim from Nigeria\'s poorer North, while Jonathan comes from a Christian and animist South that is rich with oil. Buhari praised voters for exercising their right peacefully. ""Your vote affirms that you believe Nigeria\'s future can be better than what it is today,"" he said in his statement. ""You voted for change, and now change has come."" Buhari campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime. He stressed that Nigeria\'s security needs to be the next government\'s focus. His campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption. He ran under the slogan of ""new broom,"" and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote. Despite years of democracy, analysts say, corruption has hindered Nigeria from building a stable economy. One of Buhari\'s biggest challenges will be Boko Haram, which has been terrorizing Nigeria as it tries to institute a strict version of Sharia law in the country. In the past few years, the terror group has bombed churches and mosques, killed hundreds of people and kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school. Even the presidential vote had to be postponed because of the radical militants. The election was originally scheduled for February 14, but was delayed six weeks because the military needed more time to secure areas controlled by Boko Haram. Yet the violence persisted. On Saturday, residents in the northeastern state of Gombe said at least 11 people were killed in attacks at polling stations, apparently by Boko Haram extremists. Jonathan had been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram. Before the election, African affairs analyst Ayo Johnson said the vote would come down to who could make Nigeria feel safe. ""Many Nigerians will not forget (Buhari) was a military leader during a dictatorship,"" Johnson said. ""Or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism."" Boko Haram isn\'t the only obstacle facing the new president. The economy is another major issue. Nigeria overtook South Africa last year as the region\'s largest economy. Nigeria is one of Africa\'s largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the United States. It also hosts many international oil companies and workers. But many complain that the country\'s vast wealth from oil exports doesn\'t trickle down to the average citizen. As many as 70% of Nigerians live below the poverty line, surviving on less than a dollar a day. Christian Purefoy reported from Lagos; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN\'s Stephanie Busari, Faith Karimi and Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.\n\noutput:'}
Below is a summary of the news:
Muhammadu Buhari won Nigeria's presidential election on March 28th with a margin of approximately 2 million votes. He promised to aggressively fight corruption and tackle the root causes of violence and instability in Nigeria, including Boko Haram. Buhari previously held political power in Nigeria through a military coup in 1983 and has struggled with reconciliation after defeating the ruling party in the election. The election faced setbacks due to continued violence by Boko Haram, which led to a delay in the vote. Despite these issues, analysts believe Buhari is the most qualified to tackle the challenges facing Nigeria, particularly Boko Haram.

One of the fugitives on the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted is wanted on multiple charges in Texas, per officials from the department.
According to the FBI, on May 11, 2012, a couple from Texas exchanged marriage vows and celebrated with a reception shortly after. Less than 48 hours later, per officials, the 26-year-old bride, Estrella Carrera, was tragically discovered in her apartment's bathtub, still in her wedding attire, having succumbed to fatal stab wounds.
The FBI has formally accused her newlywed, now 41-year-old Arnaldo Jiminez, of being responsible for this terrible crime. According to investigators, Jiminez allegedly stabbed Estrella while they were in his black four-door Maserati, and then he moved her lifeless body to the bathtub in her Burbank, Illinois apartment.
The FBI's pursuit of evidence in this case began with their focus on Jiminez's movements. Officials stated that they discovered that on May 12, his cellphone signal was traced to various locations, spanning from Chicago to Southern Illinois, Memphis, Tennessee, and finally culminating in Arkansas, all within a single day. The following day, his cell phone was registered in Houston, Texas, and eventually traced to Hidalgo, Mexico, according to investigators.
During the same year, law enforcement arrested Jiminez's brother on drug-related charges, which led to the discovery of Arnaldo's Maserati stored in the garage, according to a statement from the FBI. Traces of blood were found inside the vehicle, further supporting the theory that Jiminez may have committed the crime in the car before moving the body to the bathtub, per FBI officials.
Investigators stated they suspect that Jiminez's brother might have driven him to Mexico in the same vehicle and left him there. Since the night of the wedding, Jiminez has managed to elude authorities and remains unaccounted for. FBI officials believe he is likely in hiding in Mexico, specifically in the Santiago Papasquiaro area or in Reynosa, Tamaulipas.
A $250,000 reward is being offered for information leading to Jimenez's arrest, per officials.
FBI officials also stated that Jimenez should be considered armed and dangerous. If you have any information concerning this person, please call 1-800-CALL-FBI or contact your nearest American Embassy or Consulate.

2820,3402,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"Authorities in South Carolina have released dash cam video in connection with the fatal shooting of Walter Scott, but the footage does not show the actual shooting. Video from the patrol car of North Charleston's Michael Slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and Scott. Slager approaches Scott's vehicle. The two men speak. Scott tells the officer he does not have insurance and is in the process of purchasing the vehicle. Slager then returns to his patrol car. Scott exits his vehicle, briefly, and Slager tells him to stay in the car. Scott then gets out of the car, again, and runs away, out of the range of the dash cam. The video, which was released Thursday, also shows a passenger in Scott's car. The passenger's identity was not given in a police report obtained by CNN, but another officer responding to the incident said in the report that the passenger was detained and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart told CNN the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend. He did not identify the friend by name. When asked what might have motivated Scott to run, Justin Bamberg, another attorney for the family, speculated that Scott might have been concerned about child support issues. Scott owed back payments on child support totaling $18,104.43, according to Charleston County family court documents obtained by CNN. He had a bench warrant issued against him for failure to pay at the time he was stopped by Slager. But Bamberg was adamant the dash cam video does not alter what happened. ""This dash cam footage does not change the fact that at the moment the officer shot and killed Mr. Scott -- that shooting was completely unjustified. And that is the key point of both the criminal investigation and the civil lawsuit,"" the lawyer said. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing more information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing that's being conducted by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Many questions remain about what happened on Saturday when Officer Slager pulled Scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight. In the police report that CNN obtained, a responding officer said that Slager said that at one point he started to chase Scott down a street. ""Shots fired and the subject is down,"" the officer writes that Slager said. ""He took my Taser."" But a witness who shot cell phone video of the incident says he never saw Scott try to get Slager's Taser. Feidin Santana was walking to work when he saw Slager and Scott struggle on the ground, he told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday. Santana then took out his phone and started recording video. ""I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott,"" Santana said. Then, Santana said, he heard the sound of a Taser. It seemed to Santana that Scott was trying to get away and avoid being zapped with the Tasered again. On Thursday, a second witness spoke to CNN about what she saw. Gwen Nichols said she was in the neighborhood when she heard police cars speeding by and, curious, she followed them. She saw Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot. ""It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,"" said Nichols, who said she has not yet talked to police about what she saw. ""I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying: 'Stop!' "" she said. Feidin showed the video to the Scott family. But Santana has said fear for his own life almost kept him from revealing the tape. In interviews with MSNBC and NBC, Santana recalled the moments when he recorded the video. ""I ... thought about erasing the video,"" Santana told MSNBC's ""All in With Chris Hayes"" in an interview that aired Wednesday evening. ""I felt that my life, with this information, might be in danger."" The video shows Slager shooting eight times at Scott as Scott runs away. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear. An autopsy showed that Scott suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body. Before the officer starts firing his gun in the video, a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's also not clear whether that is the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Slager has been fired and charged with murder. He is white. Scott, who was unarmed, was black. Timeline of events. Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. A grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case. But not everyone agreed that Scott's case is like Brown's or that race was a factor. Asked how he felt about Slager being charged with murder, Santana answered that ""no one can feel happy."" ""He has his family, and Mr. Scott also has his family,"" he told Holt. ""But I think, you know, he made a bad decision. ... Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. And there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested. And that wasn't the proper way to do that."" Lessons learned from Ferguson to North Charleston. The FBI is investigating, as is SLED. ""I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw,"" North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday. Mayor Keith Summey spoke at the same news conference, which was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who chanted: ""No justice! No peace!"" They called for the mayor to step down. Summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras ""so every officer on the street"" in the city will have one. That is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, he said. Just before the conference was set to begin, demonstrators walked in. They were led by a man wearing a ""Black Lives Matter"" T-shirt who shouted, ""This is what democracy looks like!"" 2010 census data show that North Charleston is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's Police Department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of 10 City Council members are black. It's unclear what Slager's motivation was, or if race played a part in Scott's slaying. ""We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that,"" Scott family attorney Stewart said. ""I think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature."" If convicted, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty. Who is Officer Slager? An autopsy of Scott showed that he ""sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body,"" and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: ""In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there."" When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced Slager's account of what happened was not true, he told CNN. ""There was not a struggle for the Taser,"" Anthony Scott said. ""I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway."" To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was ""running for his life"" away from the officer. ""I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that,"" Scott said. Family members have adamantly repeated that they don't want protests over Scott's slaying to become violent. And, so far, the demonstrations have been passionate but peaceful. Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she feels ""forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son."" ""He was a loving son, a loving father,"" she said. ""He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son."" Who was Walter Scott? CNN's Tony Marco, Ryan Scallan, Christine Bear, Tristan Smith, Martin Savidge, Brian Todd, Dana Ford, Sam Stringer and Evan Perez contributed to this report.

An autopsy of Scott showed that he ""sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body,"" and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner\'s Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: ""In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I\'m not sure what took place there."" When Scott\'s brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced Slager\'s account of what happened was not true, he told CNN. ""There was not a struggle for the Taser,"" Anthony Scott said. ""I didn\'t believe my brother would have done that anyway."" To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was ""running for his life"" away from the officer. ""I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that,"" Scott said. Family members have adamantly repeated that they don\'t want protests over Scott\'s slaying to become violent. And, so far, the demonstrations have been passionate but peaceful. Scott\'s mother, Judy Scott, told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper that she feels ""forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son."" ""He was a loving son, a loving father,"" she said. ""He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son."" Who was Walter Scott? CNN\'s Tony Marco, Ryan Scallan, Christine Bear, Tristan Smith, Martin Savidge, Brian Todd, Dana Ford, Sam Stringer and Evan Perez contributed to this report.\n\noutput:'}
Below is a summary of the news:
Authorities in South Carolina have released a dash cam video in connection with the fatal shooting of Walter Scott by Officer Michael Slager. The footage shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the two men, but does not show the actual shooting. Justin Bamberg, an attorney for the Scott family, speculated that Scott may have run due to concerns about child support issues; he owed back payments totalling $18,104.43. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing more information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing that's being conducted by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Slager has been fired and charged with murder. Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. The makeup of the city's Police Department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. If convicted, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty.

683,923,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"Havana, Cuba (CNN)All eyes are going to be on the new kid finally allowed to play and the big kid who for so long wanted nothing to do with him -- Cuba and the United States in the same diplomatic playground. Cuba pulled off a diplomatic coup by marshaling the support of other regional countries to insist on their attendance at the Summit of the Americas. And for the first time since 1962, the U.S. has not blocked Cuba's attempt to join. Now it's time to see how they play and who they play with -- especially Venezuela, which often falls out with Washington for crushing dissent at home and supplying Havana with billions of dollars in oil. Cuba is trying to re-establish itself at the two-day summit in Panama, arriving with more than 100 government officials, diplomats, small business people and artists. But Cuba's attempts to rebrand itself as an open, diverse society stumbled Wednesday when government supporters and anti-Castro supporters brawled in the streets of Panama. Video of the incident showed Cuban government officials exchanging punches and insults with dissidents until Panamanian police in riot gear broke up the melee. With the historic thawing in relations between the U.S. and Cuba, Washington now has urgent business to discuss with Havana. ""We have really big issues with the Cubans that do need to be solved,"" said Ambassador Vicki Huddleston, who served as the chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. She added ""The Cubans are typical of their negotiating style. You think it's going to be easy because we have said 'We are going to have good relations with you' and they say, 'That's not exciting for us and it is for you.' So they are hard negotiators as they always have been."" The forum could provide the opportunity to push forward an agreement to re-establish formal relations and re-open embassies after nearly four months of negotiations. While President Barack Obama is not scheduled to meet Cuban leader Raul Castro, U.S. officials said there will be opportunities for ""interaction"" between the two leaders. The first time the two heads of state met was in 2013 at Nelson Mandela's funeral. Their brief handshake captured the world's attention and lit up social media. Few people then knew that the two countries were secretly involved in negotiations to thaw five decades of deadlocked Cold War-era relations. Obama had said he had hoped a U.S. Embassy would reopen in Havana before the summit, but Cuban officials have said they cannot imagine a full restoration of diplomatic ties until Cuba is removed from the U.S. State Department list of countries that support terrorism. ""It would be difficult to explain that diplomatic relations have been resumed while Cuba has been unjustly listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism,"" said Josefina Vidal, the general director of U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry and lead negotiator in the talks. Cuba was added to the list in 1982, which includes Syria, Iran and Sudan. The designation carries financial sanctions which Cuban officials say further damages their already ailing economy. The State Department has sent a recommendation to the White House that Cuba be removed, paving the way for the White House to announce its intent to de-list Cuba as early as this week, two administration officials told CNN. Removal from the list ""does not relate to whether or not we agree with everything a country does or whether we agree with its political system, or its foreign policy,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. ""It's a very practical review as to whether or not a government is sponsoring terrorism."" Rhodes also dialed backed rhetoric on Venezuela, saying the country did not pose a national security threat to the United States, despite a recent declaration to that effect. The designation was meant to allow officials to target seven allegedly corrupt Venezuelan officials, but it ignited a firestorm, particularly in Cuba, which has close ties to Venezuela. Deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was a friend and admirer of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Chavez's successor Nicolas Maduro continues to send Cuba tens of thousands of barrels of oil each day, despite his country's own economic turmoil. In exchange, Cuba sends doctors, military advisers and sports trainers to Venezuela. In Cuba's state-run media, criticism of U.S. policy towards Venezuela has overshadowed the improvement in U.S.-Cuba relations. In March, Fidel Castro published a letter criticizing the U.S.' ""brutal plans towards"" Venezuela and the Cuban government promised ""unconditional aid"" to help defend against American threats. Its remains to be seen how much Cuba will risk its warming relations with the United States to back up ally Venezuela. But apparently there is little doubt among the Cuban people on what their government should do. A poll of 1,200 Cubans released on Wednesday found that 97% of the people surveyed by Miami-based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision Noticias/Fusion supported improved U.S.-Cuban relations.

The officer wounded, John Moynihan, is white. Angelo West, the gunman shot to death by officers, was black. After the shooting, community leaders in the predominantly African-American neighborhood of Roxbury, where the shooting occurred, were quick to call for calm. One said the officers were forced to return fire. Still, they were glad to see the video released for the sake of transparency. ""I think people understand that the decisions Mr. West made put his life in grave jeopardy,"" clergyman Mark V. Scott told CNN affiliate WCVB. West had several prior gun convictions, police said. Moynihan is a former U.S. Army Ranger who was honored at the White House for his heroism in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing. The ""Top Cop"" helped save a transit officer wounded in a gunbattle with the bombers. Last month, he became a gunshot victim when he and other officers in unmarked cars, but with blue lights flashing, stopped the car West was driving. When Moynihan opened the driver's-side door, the video shows, West sprang out and fired a shot with a pistol at the officer's face. As West ran away, he fired back at the other officers with his .357 Magnum handgun, police said. They returned fire and killed him. Moynihan, 34, survived with a bullet wound under one eye. He was placed in a medically induced coma at a Boston hospital. On Saturday, Moynihan was released from the hospital. ""His condition is best described as serious but improving,"" Boston police said in a statement. ""In the days after the shooting, John and his family have been strengthened, humbled and inspired by the outpouring of love and support they've received -- not only from his closest friends and fellow officers -- but also from concerned citizens and strangers from all over the country wishing him a full and speedy recovery."" A woman who was driving by at the time of the shooting suffered a flesh wound in the right arm. She was not identified. Two passengers in the car were arrested on unrelated charges involving an outstanding warrant and a probation violation. ""None of our officers like to use their firearms,""  Police Commissioner William Evans said at the time. ""It's probably the worst thing we have to do in our profession, but here, clearly unprovoked, one of our officers is shot point-blank in the face."" In April 2013, Moynihan was among officers who helped save transit officer Richard H. Donohue Jr., who was shot during a gunfight involving Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the days after the marathon bombings. In the battle, police fired nearly 300 rounds within five to 10 minutes.

2004,2514,Summarize the following news within 132 words:,"Think it's hard to redeem your miles for an airline award ticket? It depends on which airline rewards program you've chosen, which route you're flying and when you book your ticket, according to a new Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years. The magazine collected statistics comparing award-seat availability for the five biggest U.S. airlines on domestic routes. The top performer was Southwest Airlines, which offered the most award tickets, 11.9 million, and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5% of 103.1 million total passenger seats. ""The high number of award tickets is directly related to Southwest's unique combination of 'Every Seat is an Award Seat,' no blackout dates, points that don't expire, and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the U.S. and beyond, making us the largest domestic carrier in the U.S.,"" Southwest spokesperson Thais Conway Hanson told CNN. ""Unlike other carriers, we also don't charge fees for close-in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up."" At the bottom of the list was JetBlue, which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest U.S. airlines: 892,000 one-way passenger tickets, or 4.5% of its total 19.7 million U.S. seats. (JetBlue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study.) Many JetBlue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year, making it hard to accumulate miles, an airline spokesman told the magazine. By not allowing miles to expire anymore, the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them. Delta Air Lines came in second place with 5.6 million U.S. award seats; United Airlines ranked third with 5 million U.S. award tickets; and American Airlines was fourth with 3.5 million U.S. award seats. What are the world's safest airlines? Remember that award tickets aren't actually free. The cost of miles is built into everything you buy that's earning you miles, and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all. So it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully. On average, nearly 10% of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by Consumer Reports flew on domestic award tickets, but some of them weren't getting the best value for their miles. While many U.S. fliers redeemed miles on American Airlines flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco, the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket, Consumer Reports says. Better to use them on American Airlines' route between New York and San Francisco or Delta's route between Chicago and Los Angeles, which are generally more expensive than that Los Angeles-San Francisco route, according to Consumer Reports' calculations.

{'question': 'Summarize the following news within 132 words:', 'passages': 'Think it\'s hard to redeem your miles for an airline award ticket? It depends on which airline rewards program you\'ve chosen, which route you\'re flying and when you book your ticket, according to a new Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years. The magazine collected statistics comparing award-seat availability for the five biggest U.S. airlines on domestic routes. The top performer was Southwest Airlines, which offered the most award tickets, 11.9 million, and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5% of 103.1 million total passenger seats. ""The high number of award tickets is directly related to Southwest\'s unique combination of \'Every Seat is an Award Seat,\' no blackout dates, points that don\'t expire, and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the U.S. and beyond, making us the largest domestic carrier in the U.S.,"" Southwest spokesperson Thais Conway Hanson told CNN. ""Unlike other carriers, we also don\'t charge fees for close-in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up."" At the bottom of the list was JetBlue, which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest U.S. airlines: 892,000 one-way passenger tickets, or 4.5% of its total 19.7 million U.S. seats. (JetBlue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study.) Many JetBlue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year, making it hard to accumulate miles, an airline spokesman told the magazine. By not allowing miles to expire anymore, the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them. Delta Air Lines came in second place with 5.6 million U.S. award seats; United Airlines ranked third with 5 million U.S. award tickets; and American Airlines was fourth with 3.5 million U.S. award seats. What are the world\'s safest airlines? Remember that award tickets aren\'t actually free. The cost of miles is built into everything you buy that\'s earning you miles, and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all. So it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully. On average, nearly 10% of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by Consumer Reports flew on domestic award tickets, but some of them weren\'t getting the best value for their miles. While many U.S. fliers redeemed miles on American Airlines flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco, the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket, Consumer Reports says. Better to use them on American Airlines\' route between New York and San Francisco or Delta\'s route between Chicago and Los Angeles, which are generally more expensive than that Los Angeles-San Francisco route, according to Consumer Reports\' calculations. While award-seat availability is important, it may not matter as much as passengers\' overall satisfaction with an airline. Southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score (86), followed by JetBlue (85), Delta (70), American (66) and United (63). And don\'t forget the fees.

Now, the tiny settlement of Tristan da Cunha is seeking the help of architects and designers the world over to secure its future well into the 21st century. With the help of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the UK overseas territory is holding an international competition to improve aging infrastructure and make the island self-sustainable as it approaches the 200th anniversary of its settlement. As a sign of just how removed Tristan da Cunha is from the rest of the world, there are only seven family names on the islands. Those who live there are mainly the descendants of Dutch, American and Italian sailors as well as 19th century British explorers. There are also a handful of expatriate Brits. But watching hit TV series ""Lost""or reading up on William Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"" won't be required research for competition entrants. Instead, those with experience of renewable energy in remote regions, modern housing and developing cost-effective agrarian systems are encouraged to apply. ""The competition is looking at enhancing the built environment on the island (and) making all structures more energy efficient,"" the island's administrator, Alex Mitcham told CNN when visiting the UK recently. Mitcham explained that most existing homes and public buildings on Tristan da Cunha are small, bungalow-type structures made from made from a mix of concrete and local volcanic rock. Few have simple insulation that can lead to energy savings while the infrastructure for things like renewable power generation and internet provision remain limited. The island is also only accessible by sea 60-days-a-year through a small port in its only town, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. According to James Porter of RIBA Competitions, contestants will have to factor in irregular design questions such as ""how can we get the material ashore and how can we actually think of ways that we can put things together once there?"" ""There are limitations on the amount of cargo that can be trans-shipped,"" he added. In total, Tristan da Cunha is made up of four islands. Tristan is the largest land mass and the only one to house people. Two more unpopulated islands, Nightingale and Inaccessible, lie close by. A third, Gough, is situated roughly 230 miles away. Both Gough and Inaccessible are UNESCO World Heritage sites. The closest mainland port is Cape Town, South Africa, some seven days sailing time and 1,750 miles north-east. Tristan already has a pub, shop, cafe, dance hall, museum, catholic church and swimming pool. There are also two expatriate doctors, two Tristanian nurses and school teachers with some 30 students of varying ages. The island's main industry is lobster fishing, with exports reaching as far afield as the U.S., Australia, Japan and the EU thanks to a fishing company that has exclusive rights to fish in the surrounding waters. Tristan earns additional income from the sale of unique stamps, coins and handicraft souvenirs, Mitcham explained. Modest revenue also flows from tourism and visitor accommodation. ""As it is the remotest inhabited island in the world, the Tristanians are already very self sufficient, being able to produce many of their own foodstuffs (like fish, livestock and potatoes),"" Mitcham said. However, the cost of living has increased in recent years, he added. With limited transport and communication links, the islanders are also keen to see how they can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, improve the energy efficiency of properties and reduce imports. ""We are slowly updating 40-year old infrastructure,"" Mitcham said of the last time the island experienced a major redesign. That modernization happened roughly a decade after the island was evacuated temporarily due to ongoing volcanic activity. Before that period, the main way for the islanders to communicate with the outside world was by Morse code. Things have already changed a lot since then, however. ""A new water system, electrical system and waste water system have just been completed,"" Mitcham said. ""And with the 200th Anniversary of the founding of Tristan (2016) almost upon us it is an appropriate time to look at new initiatives that may be able to help the future viability of the community."" Interested architects have until mid-June to submit their initial ideas. The best will be whittled down to an initial 20 and then five after further analysis between June and September. Porter and Mitcham say the islanders will have to apply to the UK and possibly the EU for grants to fund the project. The winner is penciled in to be announced in June 2016.

Kelly Ripa turned 53 on Monday October 2. On her show, Live with Kelly and Mark, her real-life husband, Mark Consuelos, greeted her and the audience with an enthusiastic, “Good morning!”
As he kissed Kelly on the cheek in greeting, he proclaimed in a sexy way, “I wore my birthday suit for you today!”
It is commonly known that “wearing your birthday suit” means to have no clothes on. Certainly, his claim was a double meaning as he wore a very handsome suit.
In the back-and-forth banter between the long-married couple, Kelly reminded Mark that it is also their niece’s birthday and they celebrate that instead of her own these last 23 years.
Kelly made sure to flirt back to Mark with her own double-meaning comment, “I love your birthday suit.
This celebrity couple remain close as they co-host Live with Kelly and Mark. They are often seen holding hands and finishing each other’s sentences.
Mark loves hosting the show with Kelly
Kelly Ripa was first the co-host to the legendary Regis Philbin. Once he retired she co-hosted with Michael Strahan and then Ryan Seacrest.
Nowadays her husband Mark is constantly at her side. This makes for a bright and easy flowing host segment where they chat and share tidbits about their life.
Very recently Mark was sick and still wanted to come host the show. Kelly shared that despite his sickness, he still was looking forward to hosting.
Kelly is always an attentive wife and lovingly takes care of Mark’s needs. The couple has been married since 1996 and have three children together.
Kelly and Mark’s intimacy bleeds over into Live with Kelly and Mark
In the most real and at-home opening montage that the talk show had ever had, the couple are shown getting ready for their day.
In the clip, the couple brush their teeth before Mark puts his arm around Kelly and they walk out together in what they want viewers to imagine to be their New York City apartment.
The couple have an easygoing demeanor and ease that is uncommon on talk shows today. Kelly feels relaxed enough to continue a light and breezy interview style with her guests. Evidence of this happened as she interviewed the Golden Bachelor, Gerry Turner. She even flirted with him a bit in front of Mark.
Happy Birthday Kelly Ripa, may you have many more!

Tropical Storm Lidia was located approximately 950 miles south of Arizona on Thursday, 4 Oct 2023. The National Hurricane Center forecast projection for the storm will move northwestward over the next few days and then track more westward by Friday. After the Sunday time frame, the track becomes more interesting going into early next week.
According to the Arizona Weatherman, there is looking to be a radical change in the tropical system’s trajectory going into Monday and Wednesday. The Spaghetti model forecasts are mixed on the overall trajectory of this system. Some continue moving it westward, and others are recurving the system back around toward Baja Mexico. The Arizona Weatherman is looking at the potential likelihood that this change in direction is going to happen next week.
The most significant indicator the author is looking at closely is the 200 mb upper-level jet stream pattern and the major troughing forecast to set up over the Southwest U.S. into the Pacific Ocean by Monday morning. As this troughing sets up, it will be the impetus for the trajectory change for Tropical Storm Lidia to move toward the Mexican coast over the next few days. It is forecasted to enter the Southern Gulf of California by Thursday, 12 Oct 2023. Also, the current sea surface temperatures are 89 F, which is very warm due to the El Nino pattern. Furthermore, the Madden Jullian Oscillation 200 mb flow is projected to have upper-level divergence over the East Pacific basin, with both conditions enhancing tropical storm activity in the region.
Will Tropical Storm Lidia bring rain to Arizona early next week? Currently, the models are projecting most of the rain to track over Mexico, New Mexico, and Texas, not Arizona. However, this is about a week out, and conditions can change. Currently, the Arizona Weatherman looks like minimal chance for significant rain on the current track for Arizona; however, this is a week out and is likely to change.
This tropical system will be watched over the next week, and updates will be provided in the comments section if significant changes are forecasted to the path of the storm. This will be an interesting tropical system to watch for sure over the next week. Currently, there is another potential tropical wave that may develop south of Guatemala in the next several days as well. The East Pacific Basin is looking to get more active in the coming 1-2 weeks.

326,428,Summarize the following news within 123 words:,"An American teenager who helped her boyfriend stuff her mother's lifeless body into a suitcase at an upmarket hotel in Bali has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Heather Mack, 19, who gave birth to her own daughter just weeks ago, was found guilty with her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack on the Indonesian island last August. Schaefer was sentenced to 18 years in prison for battering von Wiese-Mack to death in room 317 of the St. Regis Bali Resort. Schaefer had claimed he killed his girlfriend's mother in self-defense after a violent argument erupted over the young couple's relationship. The beaten body of von Wiese-Mack was found in a large silver suitcase that the couple had loaded in a waiting taxi outside the resort.  They told the driver they'd be back soon, but after a lengthy wait he alerted hotel staff who inspected the bag, noticed blood and called police. The lovers were arrested after being found the following morning at another hotel about 15 kilometers (nine miles) away. Inside the bag, von Wiese-Mack's body had been wrapped in hotel bedding. A forensic examination determined that she had died from a blunt force to the face that fractured her facial bones and caused her to suffocate. Described as a Chicago socialite, von Wiese-Mack was reported to have a troubled relationship with her teenage daughter. Schaefer denied that the murder was premeditated. He told the court that he acted in self-defense when his girlfriend's mother started strangling him during an argument in the Bali hotel room. ""She squeezed my neck for about 20 to 30 seconds. I couldn't breathe. I had blood going to my head and my eyes were so watery,"" Schaefer told the court. He said he reached for a nearby bowl ""before she could.""  ""I couldn't see for a moment because my eyes were so watery and I was distraught, I was in a state of mind, I had no idea what was happening. I was almost about to black out. And I grabbed it and I started swinging,"" he told the court. Mack told the court her mother had threatened to kill the couple's unborn baby, according to local media. The prosecutor alleged that the two planned the murder, because Mack's mother disapproved of their relationship. After being detained by police, the couple initially claimed they'd been taken captive at the resort by an armed gang, whose members killed Heather's mother, and from whom they managed to escape. The two were tried separately, though both trials were heard by the same court, with the same prosecutors. Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 18 years for Schaefer and 15 years for Mack. Under Indonesian law, Mack will be allowed to keep her baby with her in prison for two years, after which she can nominate who should take custody.

Heather Mack, 19, who gave birth to her own daughter just weeks ago, was found guilty with her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack on the Indonesian island last August. Schaefer was sentenced to 18 years in prison for battering von Wiese-Mack to death in room 317 of the St. Regis Bali Resort. Schaefer had claimed he killed his girlfriend\'s mother in self-defense after a violent argument erupted over the young couple\'s relationship. The beaten body of von Wiese-Mack was found in a large silver suitcase that the couple had loaded in a waiting taxi outside the resort.  They told the driver they\'d be back soon, but after a lengthy wait he alerted hotel staff who inspected the bag, noticed blood and called police. The lovers were arrested after being found the following morning at another hotel about 15 kilometers (nine miles) away. Inside the bag, von Wiese-Mack\'s body had been wrapped in hotel bedding. A forensic examination determined that she had died from a blunt force to the face that fractured her facial bones and caused her to suffocate. Described as a Chicago socialite, von Wiese-Mack was reported to have a troubled relationship with her teenage daughter. Schaefer denied that the murder was premeditated. He told the court that he acted in self-defense when his girlfriend\'s mother started strangling him during an argument in the Bali hotel room. ""She squeezed my neck for about 20 to 30 seconds. I couldn\'t breathe. I had blood going to my head and my eyes were so watery,"" Schaefer told the court. He said he reached for a nearby bowl ""before she could.""  ""I couldn\'t see for a moment because my eyes were so watery and I was distraught, I was in a state of mind, I had no idea what was happening. I was almost about to black out. And I grabbed it and I started swinging,"" he told the court. Mack told the court her mother had threatened to kill the couple\'s unborn baby, according to local media. The prosecutor alleged that the two planned the murder, because Mack\'s mother disapproved of their relationship. After being detained by police, the couple initially claimed they\'d been taken captive at the resort by an armed gang, whose members killed Heather\'s mother, and from whom they managed to escape. The two were tried separately, though both trials were heard by the same court, with the same prosecutors. Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 18 years for Schaefer and 15 years for Mack. Under Indonesian law, Mack will be allowed to keep her baby with her in prison for two years, after which she can nominate who should take custody.

Chancey Allen Luna was found guilty of first-degree murder Friday for his role in the August 2013 drive-by shooting of Christopher Lane, a 23-year-old college student in Duncan, about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City. Luna was 16 at the time of the shooting. Lane, an Australian attending East Central University, was jogging when he was shot in the back by a gun fired by Luna. A jury recommended Friday that Luna spend life in prison without the possibility of parole, according to court records. Because he was under 18 when the crime was committed, he is not eligible for the death penalty. He'll be formally sentenced in June. The vehicle's driver, Michael Jones, pleaded guilty in March to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. Jones, who was 17 at the time of the murder, will be eligible for parole starting in 2051, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. Prosecutors dropped first-degree murder charges filed against the third suspect, then only 15, after he agreed to testify against Luna and Jones, according to CNN affiliate KSWO. He will now be tried as a juvenile with accessory to murder after the fact. Duncan police Chief Danny Ford told Australian radio station 3AW that when police arrested the teens, Jones offered a motive that made clear that Lane, a baseball player on scholarship, was chosen at random. ""We were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody."" After the verdict, Luna appeared to be crying as deputies led him out of the courtroom in handcuffs, whimpering  ""I'm sorry""  to a reporter. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

Last weekend, as Baltimore reacted to the death of Freddie Gray, the young man who died last week from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody, Major League Baseball had a problem on its hands. Saturday's game between the Orioles and Red Sox had gone into extra innings in Camden Yards, with plenty of fans for both teams glued to their seats. Boston fans feel at home in Oriole Park -- a so-called retro urban park built to embrace the luxuries of modern stadiums while maintaining that nostalgic feel -- because much of it was based on Boston's Fenway Park. The Boston faithful are used to being in the heart of a city to watch sports.  But when the Orioles finally pulled out a win in the 10th inning, 36,000 fans remained in their seats. They had been asked to do so by Baltimore officials due to  ""ongoing public safety issues."" The riots of Baltimore, the peaceful marches of Baltimore, the fury and unrest of Baltimore did not seem to have had much to do with baseball.  But as the always-wise Atlantic magazine writer (and Baltimore native) Ta-Nehisi Coates' take on the situation quickly went viral, it became clear that the Oriole's home stand presented a problem. Monday's game against the Chicago White Sox: postponed less than an hour before the first pitch. Tuesday's game against the White Sox: also postponed. Such action by MLB is not without precedent.  In 1967 in Detroit, the 12th Street riots forced the Tigers to postpone one game and relocate others (to Baltimore, no less).  After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., MLB postponed opening day games out of fear of mob violence.  In the wake of the 1992 verdict in the Rodney King beating, the Los Angeles Dodgers postponed several games.  The entire league went on hiatus in the wake of the terrorism and violence of September 11, 2001. Politics threaten sports all the time.  From the demonstrations against the Brazilian government before last summer's World Cup to the massacre of protesting students days before the Opening Ceremony of the Mexico City Olympics in 1968, sports knows well that it sits within the larger context of the world. Our deep investment in our teams -- beyond the tax dollars that construct the stadiums and the salaries players make (and the profits the owners and sponsors draw) -- is supposed to work to create community, to unify.  Cheering for the home team is supposed to create a sense of belonging. ""It's interesting that I have not yet heard anyone say that baseball or sport can heal this wound,""  Daniel Nathan, professor of American Studies at Skidmore College and editor of ""Rooting for the Home Team: Sport, Community and Identity"" told me.

After two postponements, the Orioles will play Chicago on Wednesday, but no one else will be invited.  In an unprecedented move by major league baseball, the public is not invited to the final game of the series, moved to the afternoon in accordance with the curfew imposed by Baltimore's mayor. While there are a few examples of fan-less games being played in the United States, none have been for such reasons, while in Europe, there have been a handful of incidents in which soccer teams have been punished for fan behavior with fan-less games. Without fans, does baseball mean anything? When the new Camden Yards made its debut in 1992, people heralded the return of the old-time stadium smack in the middle of the city.  But are the residents of that city ready to reminisce about the so-called good old days? In a recent episode of ""Real Sports,"" Chris Rock delivered a brilliant seven-minute diatribe on the fact that less than 10% of baseball players or fans are black. ""Last year, the San Francisco Giants won it all without any black guys on the team,"" he said. ""The team the Giants had to beat to get there, the St. Louis Cardinals, had no black people. None. How could you ever be in St. Louis and see no black people?"" Rock's thesis?  That baseball's sense of nostalgia encompassed by places like Camden Yards does not sit well with African Americans, whose memories of the old days are anything but good. To his credit, Orioles Executive Vice President John Angelos, son of majority owner Peter Angelos, took to Twitter to prioritize the issues at hand, focusing not on the lost games, but on the ""unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state."" Yet as much of America continues to grapple with the idea that black lives matter, it is clear that the country believes sports do matter, whether or not anyone is there to watch. And with MLB's announcement that Baltimore's weekend games will be moved to Tampa, it becomes clear that the only thing that the United States has figured out about race relations, poverty, the achievement gap, police brutality, and so on is how to keep its baseball players safe and make sure that the games go on.

2159,2699,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"Garissa, Kenya (CNN)The Kenyan government says Mohamed Mohamud, also known by aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, is the mastermind of Thursday's Kenya university terror attack, according to a tweet from the country's Interior Ministry. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, took responsibility for the attack, according to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. Mohamud is ""credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,"" according to a ministry document given to CNN. Earlier, the ministry posted a ""Most Wanted"" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, which is about $215,000. ""We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,"" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and ""is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country."" His network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's located in Kenya's North Eastern province near Somalia. CNN Exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border. Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's quarry attack, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. Also Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. ""I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,""  Daqare said. ""I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son."" He added that the two had not been in contact his the son disappeared. Daqare said he had ""really given up on him."" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi, Kenya, after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. ""Why? Why? Where are you, my children?"" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a local church, as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, ""Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself."" Horrific stories of survival and tales of massive loss continue to emerge. To survive Al-Shabaab militants blazing through her dorm, shooting and killing classmates, 19-year-old Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds. The gunmen called them out. ""(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,"" Cheroitich told CNN. ""And then, if you know, you go to the other side."" The teenager didn't see what happened next. She heard it. ""They were shooting everywhere,"" she said. ""I didn't want to open my eyes."" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. ""I was scared so much,"" she recalled. Garissa is a town about 90 miles from the Somali border. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the lawless nation. In 2013 militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming, as it promised ""another bloodbath"" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nathif Jama Adam, the governor of Garissa County. ""The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,"" Adam said. ""They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.""

{'question': 'Summarize the following news within 200 words:', 'passages': 'Garissa, Kenya (CNN)The Kenyan government says Mohamed Mohamud, also known by aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, is the mastermind of Thursday\'s Kenya university terror attack, according to a tweet from the country\'s Interior Ministry. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, took responsibility for the attack, according to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. Mohamud is ""credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,"" according to a ministry document given to CNN. Earlier, the ministry posted a ""Most Wanted"" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, which is about $215,000. ""We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,"" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and ""is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country."" His network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world\'s biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It\'s located in Kenya\'s North Eastern province near Somalia. CNN Exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border. Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December\'s quarry attack, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. Also Sunday, Kenya\'s Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi\'s father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. ""I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,""  Daqare said. ""I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son."" He added that the two had not been in contact his the son disappeared. Daqare said he had ""really given up on him."" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi, Kenya, after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. ""Why? Why? Where are you, my children?"" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter\'s hand at a local church, as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, ""Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself."" Horrific stories of survival and tales of massive loss continue to emerge. To survive Al-Shabaab militants blazing through her dorm, shooting and killing classmates, 19-year-old Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds. The gunmen called them out. ""(The gunmen) told them if you don\'t know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,"" Cheroitich told CNN. ""And then, if you know, you go to the other side."" The teenager didn\'t see what happened next. She heard it. ""They were shooting everywhere,"" she said. ""I didn\'t want to open my eyes."" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn\'t budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn\'t believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. ""I was scared so much,"" she recalled. Garissa is a town about 90 miles from the Somali border. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, but it hasn\'t confined its terrorism to the lawless nation. In 2013 militants attacked Nairobi\'s upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming, as it promised ""another bloodbath"" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nathif Jama Adam, the governor of Garissa County. ""The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,"" Adam said. ""They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business."" He said the militants were ""bent on nothing but destruction"" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. ""But that is something we need to fight,"" Adam said.

Los Angeles, California (LAI) - A recent oral ruling from the San Bernardino Superior Court has led to a preliminary injunction against the mandatory gender identity disclosure policy of the Chino Valley Unified School District Board of Education. This ruling effectively suspends the policy, which was considered harmful to the well-being of transgender and gender-nonconforming students.
The halted policy initially required schools to notify parents if a student chose to use a name or pronoun differing from the information on their birth certificate or official records. The policy also mandated that schools inform parents if students accessed facilities or participated in programs inconsistent with their official gender designation. This was to be carried out even without the student's consent and in cases where such disclosure could lead to emotional, psychological, or physical harm to the student.
The oral ruling concluded that the State of California is likely to win the case based on merits. It was stated that such mandatory disclosure policies are in violation of California's Equal Protection Clause. This development comes after a temporary restraining order was previously issued against the policy on September 6, 2023.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta applauded the ruling, stating that it is a significant step forward in upholding the rights of transgender and gender-nonconforming students. Bonta also issued a stern warning to other school districts contemplating similar policies, stating that discriminatory practices would not be tolerated in educational institutions.
The lawsuit against the Board, announced on August 28, 2023, by Attorney General Bonta, alleges multiple violations, including:
Infringement on California’s Equal Protection Clause.
Violation of California's Education and Government Code, which ensures equal rights and opportunities and prohibits discrimination based on gender identity.
Violation of California’s constitutional right to privacy, which includes both informational and autonomy privacy.
Judge Michael Sachs further elaborated in his oral ruling that provisions of Chino Valley's policy are ""facially unconstitutional"" as they violate state constitutional protections and discriminate against transgender and gender-nonconforming students. The ruling continues to prohibit the enforcement of provisions requiring parental notification under specified circumstances.
Attorney General Bonta has been an active advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, providing consistent guidance to educational authorities and initiating civil rights investigations when necessary.
A copy of the ruling granting the preliminary injunction will be made available for public viewing.

In response to renewed threats against U.S. personnel in the Middle East, the Department of Defense has reinstated an Iraq campaign medal.
According to a memorandum signed by then-Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gilbert Cisneros in August, the Pentagon once again awarded the Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal to eligible service members serving in Iraq. According to a document received by Military Times, the medal's eligibility has been renewed retroactive to January 1 and will continue through December 31, 2024.
U.S. Central Command requested the adjustment, according to Defense Department spokesman Nicole Schwegman, ""due to Iraq no longer being classified as a combat mission.""
Although the award was created in 2016 to recognize service in either Iraq or Syria, the requirements for the medal were revised in 2017 to restrict eligibility to only those who have served in Syria.
There has been a rise in hostile actions against American troops in the Middle East, notwithstanding Schwegman's assertion that the reinstatement of the award for troops in Iraq was not prompted by the recent intensification of drone operations there.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin briefed senators on Capitol Hill this morning on the Pentagon's plans to fight such actions and the escalating tensions in the region.
""Our personnel have been under frequent attack in recent days by Iranian-backed paramilitary groups. ""These assaults have got to stop,"" he said. U.S. forces, acting on the president's orders, have carried out targeted self-defense strikes against Iranian IRGC and allied targets in eastern Syria. We will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to safeguard our people if Iranian-backed militants continue to attack U.S. forces.
As combat escalates between Israel and the Islamist group Hamas, the United States is sending more troops and resources to the Middle East, where they will join the roughly 2,500 already stationed in Iraq and the 900 already stationed in Syria.

1801,2269,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was once known as the murder capital of the world. Back in 2010, at the height of cartel violence, the city averaged 8.5 killings per day. But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez. This month the city launched the tourism campaign ""Juarez is Waiting for You."" The rebranding effort started quietly a year ago, and on April 10, it was on full display. Mayor Enrique Serrano officially kicked off the campaign, giving what he called an ""unprecedented"" high-profile tour to regional leaders from the United States and Mexico. U.S. Rep. Robert ""Beto"" O'Rourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour. His congressional district includes El Paso, Texas, which sits directly across the Rio Grande. O'Rourke says there's good reason for locals to be hopeful. ""As a region, El Paso and Juarez represent 20% of all U.S-Mexico trade. The binational ties are strong and have remained strong,"" O'Rourke says. ""Yes, we had a really difficult time for a ... period. Juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world."" O'Rourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men, women and children were killed indiscriminately. Many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence. Others were victims of the drug turf war. It wasn't that long ago, O'Rourke says, that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez. ""(Now) I travel to Juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go. I always feel safe and secure."" A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. ""That was normal,"" spokesman Julio Castaneda told CNN. ""It's safer now."" The numbers from the attorney general's office seem to bear that out. More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence. ""Undoubtedly, the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions, and specifically the local police, helped. There was a coordinated effort between agencies,"" Castaneda said. ""Without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city."" The government cleaned up corruption within the local police force, and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels. Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez. O'Rourke argues that the El Paso-Juarez border is ""safer than it's ever been."" He cites the ""30 million lawful crosses from El Paso into Juarez"" last year as a symbolic step. Yet there are those who don't want to celebrate too soon. ""For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go,"" says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life. ""Just this past year (in 2014) there were 424 homicides. In 2007, there were 272. Yes, we're not as bad. But we're still very sick,"" Meza told CNN from his office in Juarez. ""In reality, we're progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity. We're still working out the corruption in the city. It's still an issue here."" With more than 40% of Juarez living below the poverty line, according to Plan Estrategico de Juarez, the future of the city will depend on ""the people's participation in public matters."" In fact, the organization's slogan is ""Nothing is fixed alone. Participate."" ""We are looking at a compromised future,"" Meza said. ""We don't talk about that. We don't have the money to generate work here."" One bright spot: U.S. investment is making a comeback. American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year. That hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago. But with the average salary at $20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores, or factories, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Meza says more needs to be done. The scars from the recent past remain. Several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti. Americans who, before the violence, came to Juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence. But in a sign of progress, the U.S. State Department amended its travel warning for the city. While it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution, it's no longer telling people not to come. Longtime residents of Juarez and neighboring El Paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed. In the last year, however, they have definitely noticed that ""life is back."" ""I measure it by the everyday coming and going of people,"" Gustavo Reveles, 39, told CNN. ""For someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis, it's encouraging to be crossing back to Juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen."" Reveles lived in Juarez until he was 15 and now lives in El Paso. He says the threat of violence is ""still a little bit concerning,"" though that hasn't stopped him in recent weeks from going to Juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks. ""Things have changed,"" he said. ""To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again. You see a semblance of what was there before. To really recover and heal wounds, there's a long way to go, but the process has started and that's a step in the right direction."" CNNMoney's Octavio Blanco contributed to this report.

88,112,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"""A long, long, time ago..."" Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece ""American Pie.""  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as ""Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie."" There is no real way to categorize McLean's ""American Pie"" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. ""The Big Bopper"" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. ""The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?"" McLean recalled.  ""Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.""  By cathartically writing ""American Pie,"" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, ""Tapestry,"" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the ""generation lost in space.""   When his cultural anthem ""American Pie"" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A Changin"" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of ""American Pie"" as one would of Henry Longfellow's ""Evangeline"" or Johnny Mercer's ""Moon River"" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of ""American Pie,"" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel ""On the Road."" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace. Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when ""American Pie"" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing ""American Pie"" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing ""and they were singing"" everybody spontaneously joins in with the ""Bye, Bye"" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes ""American Pie"" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When ""American Pie"" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like ""Danny Boy"" or ""Streets of Laredo"" or ""Shenandoah,"" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, ""American Pie"" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret ""American Pie,"" it's fair to surmise that ""the king"" is Elvis Presley, ""Helter Skelter"" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the ""jester on the sidelines in a cast"" is Bob Dylan, and ""Jack Flash"" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to ""American Pie."" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose ""American Pie"" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were ""Over the Rainbow"" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y ""Yip"" Harburg), ""White Christmas ""(by Irving Berlin), ""This Land is Your Land"" (by Woody Guthrie) and ""Respect"" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, ""American Pie"" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home.

Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing ""and they were singing"" everybody spontaneously joins in with the ""Bye, Bye"" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes ""American Pie"" so unusual is that it isn\'t a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When ""American Pie"" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it\'s almost impossible not to sing along.   Like ""Danny Boy"" or ""Streets of Laredo"" or ""Shenandoah,"" it\'s eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock \'n\' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, ""American Pie"" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the \'50s, \'60s and \'70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret ""American Pie,"" it\'s fair to surmise that ""the king"" is Elvis Presley, ""Helter Skelter"" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the ""jester on the sidelines in a cast"" is Bob Dylan, and ""Jack Flash"" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn\'t anything to compare to ""American Pie."" Normally, I don\'t like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose ""American Pie"" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition\'s importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were ""Over the Rainbow"" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y ""Yip"" Harburg), ""White Christmas ""(by Irving Berlin), ""This Land is Your Land"" (by Woody Guthrie) and ""Respect"" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, ""American Pie"" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home.\n\noutput:'}
Below is a summary of the news:
Don McLean's iconic song ""American Pie"" has sold for $1.2 million at auction, 44 years after its release. The song, which has become an essential part of American culture, is a poignant reflection on the loss of innocence and the changing times of the 1950s and 60s. With its memorable chorus and thought-provoking lyrics, ""American Pie"" has captivated audiences for generations and continues to evoke a sense of nostalgia and empowerment. The song's enduring popularity is a testament to its timeless themes and McLean's skill as a songwriter and performer.

A federal appeals court has handed Republican Kari Lake another loss in her ongoing legal battle that claims there was rampant fraud and misconduct during the 2022 midterm election in Arizona, resulting in her loss to Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs.
This latest legal defeat comes as Lake has failed to sway courts thus far in favor of her argument that electronic voter tabulation resulted in inaccuracies that made them untrustworthy for use in U.S. elections.
Lake Handed Appellate Loss
Republican Kari Lake, who narrowly lost to Governor Katie Hobbs in the 2022 race for Arizona governor, was handed another defeat in court last week as a federal appeals court threw out her lawsuit that had been previously dismissed.
The suit, which was also brought by fellow Republican Mark Finchem, claimed that electronic voter tabulation systems used in Arizona during elections were not trustworthy and had sought to have them blocked from use in elections.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that Lake and Finchem's claims didn’t show “a plausible inference that their individual votes in future elections will be adversely affected by the use of electronic tabulation, particularly given the robust safeguards in Arizona law, the use of paper ballots, and the post-tabulation retention of those ballots.”
The lawsuit targeted long lines that appeared in Arizona's most populous county during Election Day, the result of a printer error. County officials have repeatedly said that despite the delays, any and all voters who came out to the polls were eventually allowed to cast their ballots.
Lake announced earlier this month that she would now be running in the race to replace incumbent Senator Kyrsten Sinema, in a campaign that will see her match up with a rising star within the Democratic Party, Rep. Ruben Gallego, in what could turn out to be a rare three-way race for the Senate seat.

HOMETOWN – From being down 21-0, Mahanoy Area had multiple chances to come out of Hometown with a storybook comeback, but could never capitalize.
The Golden Bears entered Saturday’s game with a 1-4 record as they visited the 3-2 Marian Catholic Colts.
The Colts struck first via a one yard run by senior fullback Jesse Rodino with under 7 minutes left in the first.
Freshman running back Rory Dixon would find paydirt later in the first on a four yard run, set up by a long pass from senior quarterback Bruce Hopeck to senior receiver Brandon Klitsch.
Another short-yardage run by Dixon — who amassed 100 yards on the ground — would give the Colts a 21-0 advantage with 7:30 left in the second quarter.
Cue the start of a Golden Bear comeback.
With seconds left in the half, junior quarterback Levi Terry found a receiver Austin Green in the endzone to score.
Halfway through the third quarter, senior running back Colm McGroarty punched it in from a yard out. With a failed point after, the Bears were down 21-7.
A fumble on the ensuing Marian drive gave the Bears a chance to tie it up, but Marian’s defense kept them at bay for the remainder of the game.
The Colts secured the victory 21-13 to move to 4-2 as the Bears fell to 1-5.

A North Carolina family struggles to understand what happened to their loved one after discovering his body was mistaken for a Halloween prop. KSN reports that Robert Owens' body was found in China Grove and believed to be a Halloween decoration for days before someone discovered his body.
To make matters worse, the family learned that the gardener mowed around his body, believing he was part of the lawn Halloween decoration. A Few days after the gardener mowed the lawn around his body, someone made the horrific discovery and notified the family.
""Don't know how you can do that,"" said Owens' sister, Haley Shue. ""Mow right beside someone and assume that they're Halloween decorations at a house no one lives at.""
Fox News reports that Owens' family last saw him on Sunday, October 1. A week after that, police found him in China Grove with barely any clothes on and face down on the lawn of a house that had been vacant ""for quite some time.""
Owens' sister says that her brother had never been to the house, so the family is confused about how he ended up on the lawn. Police said the man had not been shot or had any visible reasons for his cause of death.
The family learned that he had cuts and scrapes on his arms, leading them to believe he fought for his life. Heley confirmed that her brother was a recovering drug addict, so it's possible he fell off the wagon. But his sister points out that still doesn't explain how her brother ended up nearly nude on a lawn he's never been to.
The police don't suspect foul play in Owens's death. Even so, the police department says they are still investigating his death and hope to have more details about his passing to his loved ones.

Over the last week, Israel was attacked by the terrorist group Hamas. Tensions mount as Israel mounts a response.
Israel has already locked down the West Bank and launched missiles at suspected terrorist sites.
United States President Joe Biden has sent one aircraft carrier strike group and is possibly sending a second in a show of support of Israel.
The attack also reaches people here in Michigan. Israel is a population destination for religious groups to visit.
Now, a Michigan church group is stuck in Israel.
Audacity reports there are at least two dozen members of a Novi based church in Israel. The country is locked down, and the Tel Aviv airport was a target of Mamas attacks.
Pastor Jon Morales, his wife Anna, and an additional 25 members of the Oak Pointe Church are in the country.
Anna told WWJ, “We were being told by people on the street and our tour guide to get inside the hotel. We could hear the booming, the bombs, as we were going in.”
Pastor Jon recounted rushing into the hotel basement as alarms sounded.
Jerusalem is north of where the attacks took place and so far the group is safe. They have not been able to make arrangements to get home.
“They’re accustomed to a degree of conflict and things happening, but this is just a different scale altogether. They’re just shocked, family members are being called to active duty,” Jon Morales said.
Several church groups around the country were in the country when the attacks happened. Detroit Lions Linebacker Alex Anzalone’s parents were part of a Florida based group and are also stuck in Israel.
So far at least nine Americans have died in the conflict and an unknown number have been kidnapped.
Reports indicate that Israel has regained control along the West Bank and has been launching retaliatory strikes.

A weekend in Santa Barbara, California, is the backdrop for a mystery that has haunted authorities for decades. It was on December 6, 1992, that 29-year-old Stanford University graduate Nancy Branch was making her way home back to Palo Alto, California, with her fiancé Kevin Clarke (31) and newlyweds Alan Stewart (29) and Amy Haxton Stewart (31). Amy, a University of California, Los Angeles graduate, had reportedly married Alan only six weeks prior. The pair had plans of honeymooning in South Africa one month later.
The Circumstances
The foursome of friends made their way to the Santa Barbara Airport to return to Palo Alto so that one of the couples could purchase their Christmas tree. They boarded a single-engine Piper Archer airplane, and according to The Charley Project, the last time there was communication from the plane was eight minutes later.
The pilot didn't alert anyone that there were problems with the aircraft, although the weather was described as ""treacherous."" The plane never arrived in Palo Alto, and while there were searches conducted by professionals near and far, there was no indication that the plane had any sort of accident. ""Investigators received a tip that it had crashed somewhere near the Big Basin area of California, but no evidence was discovered,"" TCP writes. It's believed that everyone on board is deceased, but they've remained missing persons because this mystery hasn't uncovered remains of either the persons involved or the aircraft.
For context, the drive from Santa Barbara to Palo Alto is about five and a half hours.
What To Know
At the time of her disappearance, Nancy was 5 feet 3 inches tall and 120 pounds. She has brown hair and brown eyes. There wasn't much else included in the National Missing & Unidentified Persons System database.
Anyone with information about this case is urged to contact the Menlo Park Police Department at (650) 330-6343 or their local authorities. The agency case number is 92-4968.
Please share this story about Nancy Branch to reignite the investigation into the disappearance of these four people. She is our sister, and her life matters.

1493,1907,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"My name is Mark Goodacre, and I am a professor of New Testament and Christian origins in the Department of Religious Studies at Duke University. I was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on CNN's ""Finding Jesus."" I also appeared in each episode of the program. Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the ""Finding Jesus"" Facebook page during the season finale about Mary Magdalene. Below are some of the most interesting, and my answers to them. They have been edited for style and clarity for this article:. Anarie Kennedy: The copy we have of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene comes from the second century, but is it possible that the gospel itself could be older (like first century)? Goodacre: Actually, the copy we saw in the show dates from the fifth century. It is currently located in Berlin, Germany. Although it's our most complete manuscript, it is missing several pages. There are two other fragments of the Gospel of Mary, both in Greek, and both dating from the third century. It is difficult to date the Gospel itself. One of the difficulties is that there are no references to it at all in antiquity. Our best guess is that it was written at some point in the middle to late second century. Gustavo Odría:  Where can we get a good translation of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene? Goodacre: There are several good translations of the Gospel of Mary. One suggestion is Karen King's ""The Gospel of Mary of Magdala: Jesus and the First Woman Apostle."" That book also has good introduction and discussion materials. One thing that is worth adding is that the Gospel is not actually called ""The Gospel of Mary Magdalene."" The term ""Magdalene"" does not come at all in the texts we have of the Gospel. The heroine is simply called ""Mary."" Edward James Reeves: I would like to know what really happened to Mary Magdalene? Where did she go? Who last saw her? Goodacre: This is one of the great mysteries about the character! She is so prominent at the end of each of the canonical Gospels, and the reader is expecting to see more of her and to hear more about her in the rest of the New Testament, but there is nothing. She is not mentioned in Acts of the Apostles, or in Paul's letters, or anywhere else. One possibility is that the early church suppressed her memory and chose not to tell the story of this famous female apostle. But if that is the case, it is surprising that the Gospel writers pay so much attention to her in their Passion and Resurrection narratives. Another possibility, and we touched on this in the episode, is that Mary died not long after the events narrated in the Gospels. Perhaps she was a wealthy, elderly widow? @turnbullteacher: Wouldn't Church Fathers writing in the second century have written if Jesus was married or not? Goodacre: That's a good question. There is actually nothing in second century writers that says that Jesus was married and Clement of Alexandria (died 215 AD) takes for granted that Jesus was not married. When the ""Gospel of Jesus' Wife"" was published in 2012, it was at first thought that this might witness to a tradition of Jesus being married from as early as the second century, but it is now clear that the fragment is a modern forgery. @anna585858: Do you think Magdalene is a nickname or reference to Mary's hometown? Goodacre: It's a good guess that ""Magdalene"" refers to Magdala, and so her name would refer to her hometown, just as Jesus the ""Nazarene"" is from Nazareth. There are other characters in the New Testament who are identified by their hometowns. For example Simon of Cyrene and Joseph of Arimathea. You are right, though, that it could be a nickname and that it might not have anything to do with Magdala. @AllSaintsRadio: Why was the Gospel of Mary Magdalene left out of the canon of 66 Biblical Books? Goodacre: This is a tough one because it is not clear that it was ever in contention. The Gospel of Mary is not even mentioned in any of the extant lists of early Christian works. But in any case, the book was probably written too late to have had a chance of competing with Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, all of which are written by the end of the first or, at the latest, the beginning of the second century. Further, the Gospel of Mary's theology is different from the theology of what became the four canonical Gospels. @StephanoleDReed: Where is it (said) that Jesus had a wife? Goodacre: There are no ancient texts in which Jesus had a wife. The closest we get to the idea is the Gospel of Philip in which Mary Magdalene is described as Jesus' ""companion,"" one of three women who always ""walked with the Lord."" The same Gospel says that Jesus used to kiss her often, but we don't know whereabouts he kissed her because there is a hole in the manuscript at just that point! However, the Gospel of Philip is probably too late (late second to mid-third century) to be able to tell us anything reliable about the historical Mary Magdalene. Funding Jesus: Who bankrolled Christ's ministry? I would like to thank everyone for their great questions over the last six weeks. Sorry that fellow on-camera expert Candida Moss and I could not get to all of them. Thanks too for all the encouraging words about ""Finding Jesus."" We are pleased that so many of you have enjoyed and profited from watching it.

The heroine is simply called ""Mary."" Edward James Reeves: I would like to know what really happened to Mary Magdalene? Where did she go? Who last saw her? Goodacre: This is one of the great mysteries about the character! She is so prominent at the end of each of the canonical Gospels, and the reader is expecting to see more of her and to hear more about her in the rest of the New Testament, but there is nothing. She is not mentioned in Acts of the Apostles, or in Paul\'s letters, or anywhere else. One possibility is that the early church suppressed her memory and chose not to tell the story of this famous female apostle. But if that is the case, it is surprising that the Gospel writers pay so much attention to her in their Passion and Resurrection narratives. Another possibility, and we touched on this in the episode, is that Mary died not long after the events narrated in the Gospels. Perhaps she was a wealthy, elderly widow? @turnbullteacher: Wouldn\'t Church Fathers writing in the second century have written if Jesus was married or not? Goodacre: That\'s a good question. There is actually nothing in second century writers that says that Jesus was married and Clement of Alexandria (died 215 AD) takes for granted that Jesus was not married. When the ""Gospel of Jesus\' Wife"" was published in 2012, it was at first thought that this might witness to a tradition of Jesus being married from as early as the second century, but it is now clear that the fragment is a modern forgery. @anna585858: Do you think Magdalene is a nickname or reference to Mary\'s hometown? Goodacre: It\'s a good guess that ""Magdalene"" refers to Magdala, and so her name would refer to her hometown, just as Jesus the ""Nazarene"" is from Nazareth. There are other characters in the New Testament who are identified by their hometowns. For example Simon of Cyrene and Joseph of Arimathea. You are right, though, that it could be a nickname and that it might not have anything to do with Magdala. @AllSaintsRadio: Why was the Gospel of Mary Magdalene left out of the canon of 66 Biblical Books? Goodacre: This is a tough one because it is not clear that it was ever in contention. The Gospel of Mary is not even mentioned in any of the extant lists of early Christian works. But in any case, the book was probably written too late to have had a chance of competing with Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, all of which are written by the end of the first or, at the latest, the beginning of the second century. Further, the Gospel of Mary\'s theology is different from the theology of what became the four canonical Gospels. @StephanoleDReed: Where is it (said) that Jesus had a wife? Goodacre: There are no ancient texts in which Jesus had a wife. The closest we get to the idea is the Gospel of Philip in which Mary Magdalene is described as Jesus\' ""companion,"" one of three women who always ""walked with the Lord."" The same Gospel says that Jesus used to kiss her often, but we don\'t know whereabouts he kissed her because there is a hole in the manuscript at just that point! However, the Gospel of Philip is probably too late (late second to mid-third century) to be able to tell us anything reliable about the historical Mary Magdalene. Funding Jesus: Who bankrolled Christ\'s ministry? I would like to thank everyone for their great questions over the last six weeks. Sorry that fellow on-camera expert Candida Moss and I could not get to all of them. Thanks too for all the encouraging words about ""Finding Jesus."" We are pleased that so many of you have enjoyed and profited from watching it. If you would like to explore these issues in more detail, perhaps I might recommend my podcast, the NT Pod, which you can find on iTunes or at http://podacre.blogspot.com.\n\noutput:'}
Below is a summary of the news:
Professor Mark Goodacre, a scholar of New Testament and Christian origins, answered questions from viewers on the CNN series ""Finding Jesus"" regarding Mary Magdalene. Questions included the age of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, the possibility of Jesus having a wife, and the source of funding for Jesus' ministry. Goodacre explained that the Gospel of Mary Magdalene is not actually called that and that its origin is uncertain, with the earliest surviving copies dating back to the fifth century. He also noted that there is no mention of Jesus having a wife in ancient texts, and that the Gospel of Philip, which mentions Mary Magdalene being Jesus' ""companion,"" is likely too late to be historically accurate. Finally, Goodacre suggested that the funding for Jesus' ministry is unknown, but that it is possible that wealthy supporters or religious organizations may have played a role.

A trip to the pumpkin patch took a horrific turn when a 25-year-old man allegedly drove at speeds exceeding 90 mph, resulting in a catastrophic collision that claimed the lives of his girlfriend and their 2-year-old daughter. Derrius Tolson now faces two counts of first-degree involuntary manslaughter as the details of the deadly crash come to light.
The incident unfolded on a fateful Saturday, October 14th, when Tolson sped through a red light at the exit ramp for southbound I-435. A patrolling Kansas City Police officer had noticed that Tolson's Jeep was in a reckless chase or race with another vehicle, leading to this tragedy.
Tolson's Jeep was hurtling at an estimated speed of 92 to 94 mph within a 40 mph zone when it collided with a Honda Accord, sending the Jeep tumbling multiple times. While Tolson survived the crash with minor injuries, his girlfriend, identified as Deja Perkins, was tragically pronounced dead at the scene. The couple's 2-year-old daughter, who was ejected from the vehicle, was found lifeless in the grass nearby.
Remarkably, the driver of the Honda emerged without apparent injuries. She recounted hearing a deafening crash and seeing a vehicle overturning to her right just before the impact.
Another witness, driving a Penske Ford 350 van, confirmed that the blue Dodge Challenger, linked to the fatal race, collided with the van before the disaster. It became evident that the vehicles were racing against each other.
Tolson disclosed that he had been driving his family to the pumpkin patch. Just an hour before the accident, he had dropped off his stepdaughter. The fatal encounter with the racing vehicles took place when they encountered a mysterious Chrysler 300 with no license plate and tinted windows.
Tolson recounted that the driver of the Chrysler seemed to challenge him at a traffic intersection. Feeling threatened and surrounded by the Chrysler, he accelerated in an attempt to distance himself. Unfortunately, the risky move led to the tragic flip-over of his Jeep. Tolson admitted to running a red light before the collision.
The authorities also discovered a loaded firearm and a backpack containing marijuana and scales near the crash site. Tolson confessed that these items belonged to him, and he had been using marijuana recreationally.
Tolson currently remains in custody on a $500,000 bond. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and additional charges could follow as the tragic consequences of his high-speed drive continue to be revealed.

2419,2983,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"Australia has recalled its ambassador to Indonesia for consultations after two Australians were among eight drug smugglers executed by firing squad early Wednesday. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott called the executions ""cruel and unnecessary"" because both men, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, had been ""fully rehabilitated"" during a decade in prison. Abbott didn't say what permanent actions, if any, would be taken against Indonesia. ""This is a dark moment in the relationship, but I'm sure the relationship will be restored,"" he said. One of the men's Indonesian lawyers, Todung Mulya Lubis tweeted his apologies. ""I failed. I lost,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."" Indonesian President Joko Widodo appeared to shrug off the diplomatic recall, telling reporters that ""our legal sovereignty must be respected. We also respect other countries' legal sovereignty."" Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said the country had no plans to recall its own ambassador in response. ""This is a legal case. This is not a political case so at this very stage, we do not have any plan to call our ambassador back from Canberra,"" he said. Six other inmates were executed, including Nigerians Raheem Salami, Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Okwudil Oyatanze and Martin Anderson; Indonesian Zainal Abidin and Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte, who was said to be mentally ill. On Wednesday, Brazil's foreign ministry released a statement expressing ""deep sadness"" at Gularte's execution, saying that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff had urged her Indonesian counterpart to spare him due to his ""psychiatric condition."" Gularte is the second Brazilian to be executed in Indonesia this year, with the first -- Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira -- prompting the country to recall its ambassador for consultations. The Indonesian government had originally announced that nine prisoners would be executed, but at the last moment Filipina Mary Jane Veloso was spared. ""We are so happy, so happy. I thought I had lost my daughter already but God is so good. Thank you to everyone who helped us,"" her mother Celia Veloso told CNN. Philippines embassy officials said Veloso would be returned to Yogyakarta prison in Central Java later on Wednesday. No reason was given for the reprieve but it may relate to developments in her case late on Tuesday. CNN Philippines reported that Veloso's alleged recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio and her partner Julius Lacanilao, surrendered to authorities. The report said Sergio had denied all accusations in relation to Veloso's case. Veloso's lawyers claimed the mother-of-two was the victim of human trafficking. They say she was offered work in Malaysia, but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and wasn't aware the bag she'd been given for the return journey to Indonesia was filled with drugs. A tenth prisoner, Frenchman Serge Atlaoui, was also scheduled to be executed but his case was delayed while a court considers a legal challenge. Candlelight vigils were held for Chan and Sukumaran in the hours ahead of the expected execution. The men's legal teams had been fighting for years for a stay, but it wasn't to be. The men -- then aged in their early twenties -- were arrested in 2005 as part of the ""Bali Nine,"" a drug smuggling gang that intended to import 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of heroin from Bali to Australia. They failed. The pair were transported with other prisoners to Indonesia's so-called ""execution island"" in March, and after being given 72-hours notice of their execution on Saturday, Chan married his longtime girlfriend, Febyanti Herewila, on Monday in prison. The executions of Sukumaran and Chan came despite the fact that both this week received a court date of May 12 to hear an outstanding legal challenge. On Tuesday, lawyers for the men also said Indonesia's Judicial Commission had yet to properly investigate claims of corruption during their original trial and sentencing. They said three of the men's Indonesian lawyers had been summoned to attend the commission on May 7. However, before the executions, Indonesia insisted that all legal avenues had closed. On Tuesday, the prisoners' families were heard wailing as they boarded a boat for the execution site. Visiting hours were extended until 8 p.m. to give them extra time before they were asked to leave. Under Indonesian law, the death penalty is carried out by a 12-man firing squad, although only three guns are loaded with live ammunition. Prisoners are given the choice of whether to stand or sit, and whether they want to wear a blindfold, hood or nothing. The shots -- aimed at the heart -- are fired from between 5 and 10 meters (16 to 33 feet), according to Amnesty International. After the executions, the rights group released a statement condemning them as ""reprehensible"" and issue fresh calls for a moratorium on the death penalty. While the Bali Nine have garnered much international attention, their punishment is part of a larger government effort to combat illegal drug trafficking. Indonesian President Widodo has insisted that Indonesia would not be swayed by appeals for clemency because the country is dealing with a ""drugs crisis."" He told CNN in January that clemency would not be extended to drug traffickers, leading to an appeal from Chan and Sukumaran that their cases hadn't been properly considered. Lawyers for the two men said they underwent radical rehabilitation during their 10 years in Kerobokan prison and were helping to counsel and support other inmates. Chan was ordained as a Christian minister who led prayer meetings, while Sukumaran became an accomplished painter and established his own art classes inside the Bali prison. The Indonesian government didn't confirm until late Tuesday that the executions were to go ahead. Preparations were clearly underway earlier that day, with the arrival of ambulances at the port where boats leave to go to Nusa Kambangan island where the prisoners were being held. Images showed individual crosses bearing the prisoners' names and the date April 29, 2015. Families were in little doubt as to what lay ahead. When reports of his death emerged, Sukumaran's cousin tweeted: ""I love you more than you can imagine. Your legacy will live on. I promise. Save me a place in heaven."" CNN's Tasha Tampubolon contributed to this report.

A church choir singer with an infectious sense of humor, she was a beacon of happiness to those around her.
2018 brought a new chapter to Jasmine's life when she learned she was expecting a baby. Eagerly looking forward to motherhood, she had chosen the name ""Jamillia"" for her soon-to-be-born daughter. However, fate had different plans, and in a twist of events, Jasmine mysteriously disappeared in 2019, while she was seven months into her pregnancy.
On the evening of February 18, 2019, after being dropped home by her grandmother, Jasmine was alone. It's unclear where her grandmother headed, but something had perturbed Jasmine that day, though she refrained from discussing it with anyone. Later that night, during a seemingly routine phone call with her aunt, Jasmine gave no hint of any distress. They made plans for her prenatal checkup the next day.
However, when the time came, Jasmine was nowhere to be found. Calls to her went unanswered, and it soon became evident that something was amiss. Growing increasingly anxious, her family reported her missing on February 20th.
Disturbingly, in the days leading up to her disappearance, Jasmine had confided in her sister Shantavia about unwelcome attention she was receiving from her unborn child's father. His insistent calls at her workplace and on her personal phone were unsettling to Jasmine. He didn’t seem supportive of the pregnancy, but Jasmine was determined to embrace motherhood, regardless of his views.
The police investigation hinted at Jasmine not being alone when she last left her grandmother’s home. Indications suggest that her departure wasn't of her own volition. Adding to the mystery, all her personal belongings, including essentials like her purse, remained untouched at her home. While authorities have questioned several individuals, it remains unknown if the baby's father has been cleared of suspicion.
The quest to uncover the truth about Jasmine Robinson and her unborn child remains ongoing. Today, were she with us, Jasmine would be celebrating her 27th birthday. Anyone with potentially valuable information is urged to reach out to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office at 352–367–4083. A reward of $10,000 awaits credible leads.

Astronomy enthusiasts and skygazers are in for a treat this Saturday morning as a rare celestial event, an annular eclipse, is set to grace the skies.
This awe-inspiring phenomenon will be the last of its kind until 2039, making it a must-see event for space enthusiasts.
Distinguishing itself from a total eclipse, such as the 2017 ""Great American Eclipse,"" during an annular solar eclipse, the moon does not completely obscure the sun as it traverses between the Earth and the sun.
The moon, appearing slightly smaller than the sun, cannot fully cover the sun's disk, creating a captivating effect where the sun peeks around the moon's edges, earning the event the moniker “Ring of Fire.”
According to space.com, the phenomenon of the sun forming a ""Ring of Fire"" around the moon is a spectacular sight, attracting both amateur and professional astronomers.
The event unfolds as a unique interplay of celestial bodies and offers an incredible spectacle for sky watchers.
While the annular eclipse will grace the skies of multiple states, only the far northeastern corner of California will be in the path of the event's greatest viewing.
In this region, the moon will cover the entire sun, leaving only the sun's outer edges visible.
However, the rest of Northern California will also be in a favorable position to view this celestial wonder.
The eclipse's path will stretch across eight states, starting from Oregon and traversing through to Texas, offering a prime viewing opportunity for many across the United States.
This celestial event has sparked excitement and anticipation among both seasoned astronomers and those just starting to explore the wonders of the universe.
For those eager to witness the 'Ring of Fire,' ensuring safety during the eclipse is paramount.
Experts recommend using proper solar viewing glasses or other safe solar viewing methods to protect one's eyes while enjoying this rare celestial display.

1805,2273,Summarize the following news within 200 words:,"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was once known as the murder capital of the world. Back in 2010, at the height of cartel violence, the city averaged 8.5 killings per day. But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez. This month the city launched the tourism campaign ""Juarez is Waiting for You."" The rebranding effort started quietly a year ago, and on April 10, it was on full display. Mayor Enrique Serrano officially kicked off the campaign, giving what he called an ""unprecedented"" high-profile tour to regional leaders from the United States and Mexico. U.S. Rep. Robert ""Beto"" O'Rourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour. His congressional district includes El Paso, Texas, which sits directly across the Rio Grande. O'Rourke says there's good reason for locals to be hopeful. ""As a region, El Paso and Juarez represent 20% of all U.S-Mexico trade. The binational ties are strong and have remained strong,"" O'Rourke says. ""Yes, we had a really difficult time for a ... period. Juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world."" O'Rourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men, women and children were killed indiscriminately. Many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence. Others were victims of the drug turf war. It wasn't that long ago, O'Rourke says, that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez. ""(Now) I travel to Juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go. I always feel safe and secure."" A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. ""That was normal,"" spokesman Julio Castaneda told CNN. ""It's safer now."" The numbers from the attorney general's office seem to bear that out. More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence. ""Undoubtedly, the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions, and specifically the local police, helped. There was a coordinated effort between agencies,"" Castaneda said. ""Without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city."" The government cleaned up corruption within the local police force, and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels. Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez. O'Rourke argues that the El Paso-Juarez border is ""safer than it's ever been."" He cites the ""30 million lawful crosses from El Paso into Juarez"" last year as a symbolic step. Yet there are those who don't want to celebrate too soon. ""For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go,"" says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life. ""Just this past year (in 2014) there were 424 homicides. In 2007, there were 272. Yes, we're not as bad. But we're still very sick,"" Meza told CNN from his office in Juarez. ""In reality, we're progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity. We're still working out the corruption in the city. It's still an issue here."" With more than 40% of Juarez living below the poverty line, according to Plan Estrategico de Juarez, the future of the city will depend on ""the people's participation in public matters."" In fact, the organization's slogan is ""Nothing is fixed alone. Participate."" ""We are looking at a compromised future,"" Meza said. ""We don't talk about that. We don't have the money to generate work here."" One bright spot: U.S. investment is making a comeback. American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year. That hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago. But with the average salary at $20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores, or factories, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Meza says more needs to be done. The scars from the recent past remain. Several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti. Americans who, before the violence, came to Juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence. But in a sign of progress, the U.S. State Department amended its travel warning for the city. While it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution, it's no longer telling people not to come. Longtime residents of Juarez and neighboring El Paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed. In the last year, however, they have definitely noticed that ""life is back."" ""I measure it by the everyday coming and going of people,"" Gustavo Reveles, 39, told CNN. ""For someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis, it's encouraging to be crossing back to Juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen."" Reveles lived in Juarez until he was 15 and now lives in El Paso. He says the threat of violence is ""still a little bit concerning,"" though that hasn't stopped him in recent weeks from going to Juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks. ""Things have changed,"" he said. ""To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again. You see a semblance of what was there before. To really recover and heal wounds, there's a long way to go, but the process has started and that's a step in the right direction."" CNNMoney's Octavio Blanco contributed to this report.

1000-Lb. Sisters star Tammy Slaton has been sick with pneumonia after she was spotted reportedly struggling to breathe.
An insider told The Sun that Tammy was sick only days after she was spotted allegedly struggling to catch her breath outside of her home in Kentucky.
The Sun obtained photos of the star as she was dropped off at home and reported that eyewitnesses allege that she grabbed the top of the car door as she exited to pause and catch her breath.
Then, Tammy put her hand to her chest as if experiencing discomfort or pain before walking to the front door. She seemed to struggle a bit.
The reality star was spotted at her home on October 6 and went to Atlanta only days later on October 9.
One insider claims that Tammy left to go to Atlanta to shoot promo footage for Season 5 of the show, but another reported that Tammy said she had pneumonia while on the trip.
Tammy Slaton was arrested for marijuana possession
As previously reported by Monsters and Critics, Tammy was arrested for marijuana possession earlier this year in August.
The reality TV star was charged with two counts of possession of drug paraphernalia and one count of marijuana possession.
She was initially ordered to appear for her arraignment on August 31 and then for a pre-trial conference on October 5, but Radar Online reports that she may be let off the hook.
According to Radar Online, as long as Tammy doesn’t get into any more trouble for six months, the charges will be dismissed because she completed a Marijuana Education Program.
As of this time, it has not been recorded in court records if Tammy has entered a plea.
1000-Lb. Sisters Season 5 is on the way
Season 5 of 1000-Lb. Sisters is on the way, though it might be a minute before it arrives.
While the stars have been shooting promotional shoots, filming was paused since the two Slaton sisters got into a physical fight while on camera.
Filming has since continued, but it’s still unclear when Season 5 will come out at this time.
Fortunately, there’s still good news for fans: more of Season 4 is on the way, too.
Although it hasn’t been officially announced, word on the street is that two more parts are coming to Season 4: the two-part wedding series.
Part B was allegedly going to premiere in December, but the official release date has not yet been confirmed.

On Monday, jurors will thoroughly examine those seven minutes in a trial that experts say could last months. The prosecution has said it will seek the death penalty. Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Jurors will also be asked to consider events that occurred before and after the July 20, 2012, shooting -- namely, evidence that appears to show Holmes planned his attack, even going so far as to buy his movie ticket 12 days before, along with police allegations that officers who arrived to search Holmes' apartment had to navigate booby traps incorporating gasoline and grenades. According to police, Holmes attended the midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" at the Century Aurora 16 Multiplex Theater but left through a rear door alongside the movie screen, propping it open behind him. Holmes returned in ""head-to-toe protective gear,"" including a gas mask, about 18 minutes into the movie, police said, and threw two tear gas canisters into the theater before opening fire with an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one .40-caliber handgun. The attack killed 12 people and wounded another 70, a level of violence not seen in Colorado since the Columbine High School shooting. Five days later, authorities discovered a package in a University of Colorado-Denver mail room that police say Holmes apparently sent. Colorado authorities had no previous contact with Holmes, outside of a 2011 speeding summons, and he graduated in 2010 from the University of California, Riverside, with highest honors and a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. He enrolled as a doctoral candidate in the University of Colorado School of Medicine's neuroscience program in 2011 but dropped out the following year without providing a reason, according to a university spokeswoman. Holmes faces 165 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges, but there have already been some notable legal battles in the run-up to the actual trial. In March 2013, Holmes offered to plead guilty so he could avoid the death penalty, a deal the district attorney declined. A few months later, a judge ruled that Holmes had to be restrained during the trial, via a hidden harness anchored to the floor. The defense filed an objection, conceding that Holmes exacted the violence but blaming his actions on mental illness. ""Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by movie goers on July 20, 2012,"" the motion said. Judge Carlos Samour last year ordered Holmes to submit to an additional sanity exam, saying that the previous test, conducted in 2013 at the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo, was ""incomplete and inadequate."" Jury selection began in January, and after a four-month process, 12 jurors and alternates, composed of 19 women and five men, were selected.

TAYLOR SWIFT is now the talk of the NFL (Wikipedia).
The most prominent issue in the North American sports world is not the dissolution of the Pac-12, the semi-annual collapse of the Los Angeles Dodgers in post-season play, or whether or not college cheerleaders and marching band drum majors should get NIL money like the athletes can.
What’s on (nearly) everyone’s minds and lips is what’s going to happen with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.
Is it just a platonic friendship? Since she’s richer than he is, should she pay for all the dates? Does she ever try to give him some hints on route-running? Will he take up singing when his career is over?
Not to minimize what Taylor has accomplished, but she has nevertheless become the focus of much attention. If you watch a Kansas City Chiefs game, the camera folks give us almost as many shots of her as they do beer commercials and insurance spots.
So, in a sense, Taylor has become a mascot for the Chiefs. It seems like a natural evolution from the ugly costumes for awkward-looking birds (Seahawks, Ravens, Cardinals) and Wild West themes (Rangers, Chiefs, Cowboys).
And if there’s anyone who can say with a straight face that the Philly Phanatic – other than the deeply intoxicated – represents the City of Brotherly Love well, I haven’t met him or her.
So, the Next Big Thing has been revealed. And if Taylor Swift isn’t singing the theme song for “Sunday Night Football”, well, I’ll be a Tampa Bay Buccaneer.

Mission controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, confirmed the probe slammed into the surface of Mercury, as anticipated, at 3:26 p.m. EDT, NASA told CNN in an email. NASA earlier said the probe was expected to hit the surface at 8,750 miles per hour and to create an impact crater 52 feet (16 meters) in diameter. The crash wasn't visible from Earth because it occurred on the far side of Mercury. Messenger (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) was launched in 2004 and traveled more than 6½ years before it started circling Mercury on March 18, 2011. It was the first spacecraft to orbit the planet closest to the sun. It traveled about 5 billion miles -- a journey that included 15 trips around the sun. Spacecraft to make death dive into Mercury. The spacecraft was healthy when it crashed, but was out of fuel. When scientists determined there was no way to save it, they held a briefing this month to celebrate the mission's success. ""For the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,"" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA headquarters in Washington. One of the mission's big findings: It sent back data indicating that ice in Mercury's shadowed polar regions, if spread over an area the size of Washington, would be more than two miles thick, NASA said. As the end neared, the probe sent back some final tweets thanking mission managers and counting down its final orbits. The Messenger mission is over, but scientists say they'll be busy for years studying data from the probe. And while the space probe won't be sending back anymore images, you can see Mercury with your own eyes. It's visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of May.
